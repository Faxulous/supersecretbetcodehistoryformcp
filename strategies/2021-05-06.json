As a software engineer I spent the first 10 working for two large clients where I was given \"carte blanche\" to develop systems based on rough ideas with absolutely no specification as to what technology to use. This is the holy grail for an experienced software engineer - the ability to research, trial, and implement using anything I wanted, as long as it worked. The first client was nuts and the second client moved his whole operation overseas, so about 18 months ago, after 30 years working, I was trying to work out what to do. I had a good maths background, dabbled in tennis with Betfair right at the start, and had seen the obscene amounts of money it was possible to make (and had a friend from University start a hedge fund based on his algorithms and make $200M AUD), so I thought, let's have a go (with one other partner). The goal is simple: develop a fully automated system that ensures I never have to earn a single dollar from anyone else for the rest of my life (i.e, make enough money to cover living from age 52 onwards, with a family). My view was that I was almost certain I could get there, but not sure of the timeframe. So far so good. As of right now, I am returning about double my best ever monthly earnings. But to get to the level I need, I really have to increase that by a factor of 5, because nothing lasts forever. Fortunately we chose in-play tennis, which if you bet after points, has ample liquidity to get there and more (if the model works). We are a long way from finished, and the trajectory is in no way a line straight upwards. We had our worst day ever yesterday, when we lost $60K AUD, $48K in the last 14 matches. But that happens if you are betting on an outcome, not trading to hedge (nothing like a huge amount +\/- coming down to a third-set tiebreaker). Not sure as a risk-averse person I was really cut out to do this, but the potential reward is just too big not to have a go",

This is the holy grail for an experienced software engineer - the ability to research, trial, and implement using anything I wanted, as long as it worked. The first client was nuts and the second client moved his whole operation overseas, so about 18 months ago, after 30 years working, I was trying to work out what to do. I had a good maths background, dabbled in tennis with Betfair right at the start, and had seen the obscene amounts of money it was possible to make (and had a friend from University start a hedge fund based on his algorithms and make $200M AUD), so I thought, let's have a go (with one other partner). The goal is simple: develop a fully automated system that ensures I never have to earn a single dollar from anyone else for the rest of my life (i.e, make enough money to cover living from age 52 onwards, with a family). My view was that I was almost certain I could get there, but not sure of the timeframe. So far so good. As of right now, I am returning about double my best ever monthly earnings. But to get to the level I need, I really have to increase that by a factor of 5, because nothing lasts forever. Fortunately we chose in-play tennis, which if you bet after points, has ample liquidity to get there and more (if the model works). We are a long way from finished, and the trajectory is in no way a line straight upwards. We had our worst day ever yesterday, when we lost $60K AUD, $48K in the last 14 matches. But that happens if you are betting on an outcome, not trading to hedge (nothing like a huge amount +\/- coming down to a third-set tiebreaker). Not sure as a risk-averse person I was really cut out to do this, but the potential reward is just too big not to have a go"

I am up quite a bit this time but only after 110 bets (1k markets analysed by the bot) and variance is a bitch. On the plus side I haven't had to top up my BF account for ages-haven't taken money out either of course:laughing:..but to be fair working full time, family taking time as well as and not being able to stay up and watch UK markets slowed me a bit. I can print money on NSW tracks manually for some reason (predictable volatility maybe-55 bets a race usually) but the turnover charge limits you massively.
