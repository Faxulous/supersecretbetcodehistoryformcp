You’ve done well recently purely due to your own self-motivation.\n\nGenerally, to do well, I think you either need to have the right background (programming, finance, maths, or have worked for syndicates) or you will need some advice and\/or mentoring from someone who has. One exception to that rule is <@UGV299K6H> though. Michael did you start with programming right from the start or did you use other methods of automation?\n\nPersonally it came to me as a hobby while working in banking. My first strategy didn’t work, and I was lucky with my second, so I was up and running within 3-4 months. Markets were probably easier to crack 10 years ago though. At first it did seem like a fun hobby or puzzle to be solved, and to see how far I could push it. But now after 10 years it definitely does feel more job-like to me and just the easiest way for me to make good money with the least effort. \n\nLong term it’s always relatively difficult though I think. You can’t expect edges to last forever so it’s a constant process of adapting and developing. So once the interest does disappear it can be hard to maintain the same level of profitability. A lot of it is luck and trial and error in digging for profitable strategies though, so you need a thick skin to continue through patches of “missed shots”. ",

Michael did you start with programming right from the start or did you use other methods of automation?\n\nPersonally it came to me as a hobby while working in banking. My first strategy didn’t work, and I was lucky with my second, so I was up and running within 3-4 months. Markets were probably easier to crack 10 years ago though. At first it did seem like a fun hobby or puzzle to be solved, and to see how far I could push it. But now after 10 years it definitely does feel more job-like to me and just the easiest way for me to make good money with the least effort. \n\nLong term it’s always relatively difficult though I think. You can’t expect edges to last forever so it’s a constant process of adapting and developing. So once the interest does disappear it can be hard to maintain the same level of profitability. A lot of it is luck and trial and error in digging for profitable strategies though, so you need a thick skin to continue through patches of “missed shots”. "

The path to success seems very varied for people so follow the maxim: `\"You can't tell till you bet\"`\nDon’t bet money you can’t afford to lose, don’t quit a steady job till your models are steady and if too much stress for the psyche, then don’t do it. There are consistent biases in gambling markets, so much is sure. Building the right technological process for you to exploit those biases is the hard part (flumine reduces that lift massively). Gambling market edges are not going away any time soon, as long as we face off large waves of behaviour driven money. There is not enough pro money to keep, for example, Grand National efficient vs the recreational crowd at all moments. Good luck finding hot decks.",

You want it to be hard because if it wasn't everyone would be doing it, the market would be more efficient and everyone would be making such small returns that it wouldn't be worth it. A prime example for me personally is IP horses, I havent had a chance to get round to it but numerous very smart people on this slack with experience in other sports or pre off have struggled. This to me makes me think happy days, if i can crack this there will be far less competition and greater returns"
