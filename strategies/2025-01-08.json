I suppose people with strong fundamental models for racing might be able to sniff out a dodgy runner based on strong market move and large deviation from \"expected\" implied probability.\nBut even if we could show that BSP is \"wrong\" in certain situations how would it benefit? If you have a 6 runner race, the favourite price could be spot on (say 2.0) and yet the BSP of all other runners in that race could be off. Similarly, 2 prices could be way off and yet all others could be spot on.

If yes, crack on, nobody here will convince you of anything, no matter how much data we provide\n2. If you believe quality and intent varies, do you believe that in pre-event betting, these differences might manifest themselves in terms of betting counter parties, their intentions and actions? If you think bettors are all robots who do the same thing over and over again, fine, move on, nothing to see here.\n3. If you do believe it might change behaviour, the question then become how do you qualify and quantify those changes. My hypothesis is we should see differences in behaviour (liquidity, volatility, BSP calibration, and so on), that align variation in quality. In horse racing I believe quality significantly varies from mid-week betting (outside of major festivals), to weekend betting. I believe AW and Turf racing are in essence different sports with different fundamentals, different trainers, jockeys, horses, breeding lines, _everything_, that I should expect to see differences in pre-event betting behaviour, and by looking at the data and filtering for day of week, day vs evening, turf vs AW, handicap vs stakes, at different grades, and so on, I will see variations that might be strategy impacting unless I account for them",
