        "text": "Question regarding strategy calibration: how often do you tend to recalibrate your strategy parameters, e.g. refresh the thresholds of your triggers etc? For my football betting I have always been able to keep my thresholds the same, but retrain my ML models periodically, for a few years now. Never really been an issue. For racing (which I've only been doing at scale since last Nov), I have no model, just reacting to observations in market data (so the model ends up being a bunch of handcrafted thresholds). I have no sense yet as to how quickly my calibrated values may become too stale. Does anyone do anything as basic as this, and if so, how do you keep your thresholds\/parameters up to date? Run some periodic optimization over a grid of possible thresholds?",
