That seems to be inviting adverse selection.\n\nBut let's look at a hypothetical that illustrates how it might be made to work. Suppose you built a fundamental model that gets into the ballpark for soccer match odds markets. Upon closer examination you spot that it performs well for teams in major leagues with large followings, especially for televised games. You could rationalise this as lots of fans backing their team and driving the price below what your model's idea of value and indeed \"true value\". In this scenario you could use your model to trigger trades with +EV.\n\nHowever, if you started using it to trade outside that specific scenario, you're likely to come unstuck very quickly as the market snaps up each trade where it knows better than your model, and ignores those where your model has actually taken you in the right direction.",

That seems to be inviting adverse selection.\n\nBut let's look at a hypothetical that illustrates how it might be made to work. Suppose you built a fundamental model that gets into the ballpark for soccer match odds markets. Upon closer examination you spot that it performs well for teams in major leagues with large followings, especially for televised games. You could rationalise this as lots of fans backing their team and driving the price below what your model's idea of value and indeed \"true value\". In this scenario you could use your model to trigger trades with +EV.\n\nHowever, if you started using it to trade outside that specific scenario, you're likely to come unstuck very quickly as the market snaps up each trade where it knows better than your model, and ignores those where your model has actually taken you in the right direction."
