So to keep things simple assume I was using a fixed stake and i know that for eg a MC simulation on past results were 10% (ie MC beats strategy) then i would create a go forward model and use a random number generator. Then run over a large number of iterations and count the longest sequence of losing runs ? This would be better actually that trying to calculate it in monetary terms as the loss would be proportionate to the profits at that time. Thanks again.",

So to keep things simple assume I was using a fixed stake and i know that for eg a MC simulation on past results were 10% (ie MC beats strategy) then i would create a go forward model and use a random number generator. Then run over a large number of iterations and count the longest sequence of losing runs ? This would be better actually that trying to calculate it in monetary terms as the loss would be proportionate to the profits at that time. Thanks again."
