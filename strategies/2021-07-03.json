So I always think of \"value\" as something I can relate to in life. For example, when you buy car insurance, you go to a comparison website and buy the policy that gives you the best cover for the lowest price. As such, that's \"value\" because you've purchased something at the lowest price available, based on its market valuation. Likewise for an eBay auction, you bid what you think something is worth, but ultimately, the final price is governed by supply and demand.\n\nBetting is similar and, for preplay markets, the \"final price\" could be considered as the BSP. Sometimes the BSP is over priced and sometimes it is under priced, but over a long period of time, it generally converges to the \"true\" price when compared with the implied probabilities. So that is why \"beating\" BSP is one metric you can use to determine if you are getting value. Obviously the frequency and amount of value determines whether your bank balance goes up or down, so that is where you would start analysis. The key point here is that you could compare BSP vs implied probabilities over a large sample and then pinpoint those areas where the market was clearly wrong. From there, you could then look at how the market evolved and potentially discover when and _why_ the prices were wrong. The other thing to consider here is that you don't necessarily need to know what the exact price or probability should be, you only need to know whether it is correctly aligned in relation to the other runners, i.e. false favourites, etc.",
