For this i seemingly can not check sortPrio as they are unreliable and names i can only see in the market_catalogue. I could make a dictionary from the market_catalogue where i take the leading digit from the runners name (is this always equal to its race card number? or is there a better way to get this number?) and assign it to the runners selection_id.

I m not yet sure how to match by selection_id. If i want to place an order on the FC market, i would first have to know what that selection actually is, for which i would need to know the runners represented by the number-tuple given in the fc_selection name. For this i seemingly can not check sortPrio as they are unreliable and names i can only see in the market_catalogue. I could make a dictionary from the market_catalogue where i take the leading digit from the runners name (is this always equal to its race card number? or is there a better way to get this number?) and assign it to the runners selection_id. But then i need to be able to trust that this is not going to change, as i wouldnt see that in my market_book update."
