Thank you all for the pointers I'm making far better progress!\n\nI have changed strategy and am now successful matching better than BSP (On FlumineSimulation). In fact ... I match about 100 trades correctly and 20 incorrectly per race. Which is great!\n\nBut I have vast differences in expected profit from calculation and expected profit from Flumine. Calculations make me rich :slightly_smiling_face: and simulation makes me poor :grimacing:\nI'm simulating on a months worth of Horses Win data - and so expect that this is statistically significant enough to tend them to the same expectation. (If BSP is a good indicator of probability?)\n\nFor each back trade matched I calculate expected return as:\n\nE_back = Pr(Win) * return - Pr(Lose) * stake\nE_lay = Pr(Lose) * stake - Pr(Win) * return\n\nWhere:  Pr(Win) = 1\/bsp,       Pr(Lose) = 1 - (1\/bsp),       return = (price-1)*(stake)\n\nProfit is calculated directly from Flumines market.blotter order.simulated.profit (which I'm assuming works from race results)\n\nCan anyone see any issues \/ had any similar realisations with using BSP as an estimate of Pr(win), or have any suggestions of where I might have made an error?\n\nOfcourse ... I could just engineer a green at BSP method and remove the need for expected returns ... #teamgreen :face_with_rolling_eyes:",
