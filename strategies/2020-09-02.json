I see that from the value perspective it doesn’t make much sense, but for trading order flow and also for reducing drawdowns it might be useful. What I am looking at implementing is an adjustable take profit and stop loss price for each successful order. If it’s not on the cards for an official commit, for reasons previously mentioned, any advice on the cleanest way for me to add it in to my code? Cheers ",
