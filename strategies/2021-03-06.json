Let me explain what I think you're thinking and why it's wrong: Say you had a 3 runner horse race that you knew nothing else about, you could reasonably price all runners at 3 and if you then evaluated that prediction in an information vacuum over many events it would turn out to be correct because one runner of the 3 will always win. If you 'paper traded' in your own private exchange then hypothetical bets at odds &gt; 3 would show a profit. Great, all your predictions look perfect, 3 is always 0EV.  Meanwhile someone else is looking at the same 3 runner races but they have access to some basic information about the relative quality of each horse that allows them to better price the runners. Will they agree that all horses are correctly priced at 3?  No. They will make some other model and generate from it a 0EV price that will be different to yours. Let's assume they validate that by testing over many markets so that it performs perfectly. So from your perspective (information blind) it looks like 3 is always 0EV and from his with some limited information he's generating 0EV prices that are not 3. That can make it look like there's more than one 0EV price - but that's an error. Consider what happens if you bet against him in an exchange, you've priced every horse at 3 but he knows better. Where's your 0EV now? You're backing any price he'll offer you that's &gt;3 and he's putting a deposit on a Ferrari. In this case both players have an ESTIMATE for 0V which looks perfect when evaluated internally but it turns out that one estimate is better than the other. That's because the notion of a 'true' 0EV price is predicated on a hypothetical state where all possible information is known. Anything else is an estimate that gets as close to that 'truth' as possible. I think your mistake comes from a failure to recognise that whilst your estimates of 0EV can reconcile perfectly when evaluated internally they wouldn't stand up to superior information and ultimately to perfect 'true' information.",
