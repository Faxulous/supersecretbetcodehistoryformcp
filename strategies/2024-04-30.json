Im looking to move running my scripts from running on my local machine to run within the cloud etc. My scripts are pretty straight forward (at the moment). I just to have them hosted in IRE \/ UK to avoid geoblocking etc, and also run in \"background\". Im used to running scipts through Anaconda \/ jupyter lab \/ chrome etc but this seems vey slow (start up, general navigation etc) on a 1GB RAM setup within AWS lightsail. Anaconda documentation seems to recommend 4BG+ RAM, which looking at the lightsail pricing per month is coming out at 40 USD per month. Can anyone suggest simplier set up i can go with which requires less RAM etc would allow a cheaper rate per month",
