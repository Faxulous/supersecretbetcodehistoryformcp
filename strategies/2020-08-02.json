So this is something to be aware of also. I also try and think about who's taking my bet on the other side and why they would do so. Very early on in my betfair career, I had a simple system that placed a back bet on certain triggers, and it lost money. I thought at the time, ok instead of backing Ill lay at the reverse price. We all know now that if only it was this simple :grinning: The problem is that when the lay would have been successful, you dont always get matched, but when the lay wasn't successful you almost always get matched.",

Very early on in my betfair career, I had a simple system that placed a back bet on certain triggers, and it lost money. I thought at the time, ok instead of backing Ill lay at the reverse price. We all know now that if only it was this simple "
