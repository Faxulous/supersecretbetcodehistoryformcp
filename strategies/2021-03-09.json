        "text": "Hi. A short question about using Monte Carlo methods for estimating a p-value for your strategy outcome. I have done it several times before for simple (football match-odds) strategies that simply back one outcome before game start. In these cases I simply use the probability implied by the odds, and simulate a large number of histories, to estimate the probability\nof a better outcome than my observed outcome (assumption: low p-value means edge). However, I am currently trying to validate a new strategy that will place several orders in play. Validation suddenly becomes a harder problem, since the events are not independent - and the implied\nprobabilities are ambiguous. Intuitively, it would not be meaningful to draw independent variables for each order, since the outcome of events for a single market are perfectly correlated. Right? How would you go about this?  What probabilities could function as 0-hypothesis? Maybe pregame odds?",

So if there's no causal relationship between the bets themselves  (IE you're not 'greening up') and the only link between them is that you placed them isn't it reasonable to treat each bet as if it was a separate market with a separate outcome? Obviously this is wrong - but wouldn't it get you to an acceptable answer?",

And if all your bets were stuck by different people such that each person had only one bet per market each person would happily evaluate their own single bet markets in isolation and we'd have no problem with that. So if there's no causal relationship between the bets themselves  (IE you're not 'greening up') and the only link between them is that you placed them isn't it reasonable to treat each bet as if it was a separate market with a separate outcome? Obviously this is wrong - but wouldn't it get you to an acceptable answer?"
