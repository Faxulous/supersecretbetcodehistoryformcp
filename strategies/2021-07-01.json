Then using the methods <@UBS7QANF3>  <@U4H19D1D2> <@UGV299K6H> suggested i analyse across the whole dataset returns vs spike height, then returns vs seconds from start,  then returns vs wom, then returns vs selection volume change over 10seconds, then....etc. The main \"fix\" is the 10seconds, although I have tried several variations on that, but it's a bit trickier to compare that one. From all these orthogonal variables i plot graphs to visualise affect vs returns...\nI think you probably do similar i am sure...\nAnyway ive made some progress this evening, wom variable helping <@U01PQ9SR9MJ> and ill plod on...but no late nights for me!\nCheers",

From all these orthogonal variables i plot graphs to visualise affect vs returns...\nI think you probably do similar i am sure...\nAnyway ive made some progress this evening, wom variable helping "
