        "text": "As promised, here is the first update on my yearly goal for my new strategies to equal or exceed my take home profit from existing strategies\n\nThe first attached plot shows cumulative net profit. Some comments:\n\n1. The existing strategies have very high costs associated with them. Therefore I am using 37.5% of gross profit as net profit\n2. In contrast, the new strategies have very low costs associated with them, therefore I am using 59% of gross profit where, hopefully obviously, this is almost entirely the 40% premium char - ahem, expert fee\n3. The new strategies have made approximately 0.4% of the net profit of the existing strategies to date. LFG!\n4. Since 2nd January I'm ahead of my syndicate share so haven't _personally_ been trading the existing strategies hence the flat line\nThe second attached plot shows the cumulative net profit only for the new strategies. Some comments:\n\n1. As you can see, they had a bit of a rough time yesterday\n2. I was planning on increasing the stakes but this has given me some pause. Note that I'm just being a pussy, the correct thing is still to increase the stakes. It's arguably sensible to wait until Monday anyway to minimise the impact on live trading from restarts\nThe third attached plot shows the relative profit for the new strategies. Some comments:\n\n1. `Strategy2` got deployed yesterday and only had two bets, one of which accounts for almost all of the loss for that strategy. The price was fine (according to BSP) but the staking was a bit too high for a newly deployed strategy. Lesson learned\n2. `Strategy1` is a generic strategy that I'm keen to also deploy to football but it looks like this will require some elbow grease as I'll need to optimise some market (sport) dependent parameters\n3. `Strategy0` trades all horse races regardless of country; `Strategy1` and `Strategy2` only do GB racing for now. I'd like to expand them to other countries but that's fairly low down the priority list\nMy focus for now will be `Strategy2`:\n\n• `Strategy2` bets into markets that have multiple winners; think forecasts\/exactas\/trifectas\/superfectas\/quinellas etc.\n• I'm doing some foundational work to both my shin (<https:\/\/github.com\/mberk\/shin>) and kelly (<https:\/\/github.com\/mberk\/kelly>) packages to allow for markets with more than 1 winner. Everyone will be able to take advantage of these\n• `Strategy2` currently only bets on the favourite. Being able to bet on all runners is the next step\nSome general comments:\n\n1. Knowing that I \"had to\" share this update was excellent motivation, as hoped. Without it, I might have dragged my heels over getting `Strategy2` deployed\n2. Hopefully you will agree I've been remarkably open with this update but will also understand why certain details have been held back. You're welcome to ask my anything at all - whether I can give a straight forward answer is another matter. If you know some of the details from things I've previously told you in confidence then obviously please refrain from including these in your questions. If in doubt you can always DM me\n3. My overall philosophy with these strategies is this: I'm hoovering up pennies. Hopefully there will be enough pennies that they will add up to something meaningful. There are inefficiencies every-fucking-where. Not necessarily massively profitable inefficiencies but it is free money being left on the table and the more of these I can hit as soon as possible the better my money printing machine will become. Having chunky profitable strategies to begin with helps as this encourages doing more volume\nFire away...",
