Ive never used backtesting (until very recent) and although Ive not reached the lofty heights that some on here have, Ive been very successful.  Back in the 80's and 90's I worked on some very large computer systems and we were taught a process called kepner tregoe (I think NASA used it too), which we used in trouble shooting to define the problem before beginning to fix it. Some of the large computer systems had hundreds of modules in them and quite often you could spend many hours just defining the problem. I still use some of those techniques that ingrained in me even today.\nI think if I could distil why some people are successful and not others, it is the way people see the problem and the task to be solved. They merely think differently",

Ive never used backtesting (until very recent) and although Ive not reached the lofty heights that some on here have, Ive been very successful.  Back in the 80's and 90's I worked on some very large computer systems and we were taught a process called kepner tregoe (I think NASA used it too), which we used in trouble shooting to define the problem before beginning to fix it. Some of the large computer systems had hundreds of modules in them and quite often you could spend many hours just defining the problem. I still use some of those techniques that ingrained in me even today.\nI think if I could distil why some people are successful and not others, it is the way people see the problem and the task to be solved. They merely think differently"
