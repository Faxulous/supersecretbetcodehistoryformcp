                "text": "INTRO\nAs soon as the summer sun returns to Belgium, there is a natural human migration from Francophone Wallonia to the west coast sea in the Flemish part of the country. Here, &agrave; la mer du Nord, people relax on white sand beaches and ride the famous quadracycles called cuistax. The Belgian west coast is the (maritime) backyard for many, and so I could not refuse accompanying the two local members of my family for a week &agrave; la mer du Nord. For once, I decided not to take dozens of books with me, just one&nbsp;debated&nbsp;paper&nbsp;entitled &ldquo;Can Brokers Have It All?&rdquo;, but the sun was so hot that I decided to drink mojitos on the beach.\nThe only tour&nbsp;I did was in&nbsp;Veurne, a small typical Flemish city where I tasted&nbsp;some local beers. A week later I was back in Brussels, and on July 16, 2014, Bloomberg released this story about a prop trading firm from Chicago purchasing an old tower for &euro;5.000.000 in&hellip;Veurne. What a coincidence! I&rsquo;ve researched and written about high-frequency trading (HFT) since 2012, and am quite aware of the microwave networks used by some fast players, but I did not know that as of January 2013 Jump Trading owned a tall tower in Belgium &ndash; in my backyard. Belgium being&nbsp;in the middle of the problem, geographically speaking, I decided to investigate the&nbsp;presence of microwave networks owned or used by the big HFT players here in&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;for&nbsp;my holiday homework. If Jump has a tower, competitors are all around &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a matter of&nbsp;where&nbsp;.&nbsp;My question about the towers was &ldquo;Can I Have Them All?&rdquo; and thus my investigation, perhaps obsession, began. I discovered too many things to discuss in a single post, so I&rsquo;ve split my story into five&nbsp;parts. This first part we&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;Mapping the HFT Microwave Networks&rdquo; &ndash; even if &ldquo;How I Became an Expert in Potato Fields&rdquo; would be as accurate.\nFROM CHIGAGO TO BELGIUM, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TOWERS\nThe first part of my&nbsp;book,&nbsp;6, was mostly about the rise of the HFT machines in the pre- and post-REG NMS era. Charting the surge of Electronic Communication Networks such as Island, I realized the history of Chicago markets in conjunction with the ascent of these technologies was more interesting than Wall Street SOES bandit stories. Hence the second and last part of the&nbsp;book, 5, was focused on Chicago, particularly the transitions from the old human trading pits to the computerized ecosystem now (co-)located in huge data centers.\nThe&nbsp;history of&nbsp;exchanges in the&nbsp;Windy City is a true case study for anyone interested by the&nbsp;computerization of commodities and financial markets. I&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;about the arrival of the telegraph in Chicago; the first telegraphic &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; arrived in Chicago just three&nbsp;months before the first organized exchange,&nbsp;the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT),&nbsp;was created in April of 1848.&nbsp;I even found the phrase &ldquo;flash orders&rdquo; in some 19th century Chicago newspapers, used to describe the practice of traders using fast private telegraphic lines to buy commodities they knew would rise in price in the next few seconds so that they could resell at a higher price what they had bought seconds before &ndash; sound familiar?\nThere are many other interesting predecessors of modern practices to be found. For instance, long before the existence of microwave towers like the one in Veurne, the CBOT aimed itself to tower. Its first location was the tallest house in the city, and when the exchange was obliged to erect its own building in 1885, it was both the tallest property in Illinois and the first building in Chicago to run on electricity. Frank Norris describes it in his novel&nbsp;The Pit: &ldquo;The lighted office buildings, the murk of rain, the haze of light in the heavens, and raised against it the pile of the Board of Trade Building, black, grave, monolithic, crouching on its foundations, like a monstrous sphinx with blind eyes, silent, grave,&mdash;crouching there without a sound, without sign of life under the night and the drifting veil of rain&rdquo;.\nIn the 1920s, members of the board voted to erect a new building to become &ldquo;the cathedral of capitalism&rdquo;,&nbsp;and initiated&nbsp;discussions with architects,&nbsp;traders and some of the major telegraph companies in order to find&nbsp;the best&nbsp;way to improve the social space of the pits. The traders weren&rsquo;t happy with the excess noise, and telegraph companies like Western Union and RCA were lobbying to install a multitude of fast lines. When the&nbsp;1930 CBOT building&nbsp;was erected on&nbsp;Jackson Boulevard near Lasalle Street, it had more than 4300 kilometers of telephone lines and 240,000 kilometers of telegraphic lines &ndash; first step of the rise of the machines.&nbsp;It towered over Chicago until 1965, a faceless statue of goddess of agriculture Ceres adorning the top.\nThe heart of exchange was the pit, and it correspondingly saw advances in technology. The first pit was&nbsp;patented&nbsp;by Ruben S. Jennings in 1878, and soon the CBOT build different pits without paying fees to Jennings. The inventor tried and failed to sue CBOT, and his patent was invalidated by the judges. Jennings designed the pit so that a trader could see and hear another trader under the best possible conditions. Pits had different steps for that reason; a trader sitting on the tallest steps had a better &ldquo;skyline&rdquo;, and an advantage in seeing or hearing a counterpart quickly, and trade faster than the traders in the center\/bottom of the pit. It was all about speed.\nHeight, then, played an important part in facilitating that speed. A trader&rsquo;s physical height became an advantage, which is part of the reason some traders were former basketball or football players &ndash;&ldquo;taller traders were easier to see&rdquo;. In the 1990s, some traders wore high heels in the pits to trade faster, and inevitably experienced injuries due to lack of balance. This prompted the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to impose a ruling making the maximum size of platform heels two inches in November 2000. Standardization of heel height was a way to level the playing field in terms of speed on the floor. Recently, the last European open-outcry pit the London Metal Exchange, or Ring,&nbsp;fined&nbsp;traders for breaking the rule to remain seated while dealing: &ldquo;Dealers that stand create an unfair advantage and might obstruct the view of other dealers and LME pricing committee members,&rdquo; said a spokesperson for the UK exchange.\nComputers tower above humans in speed no matter how high a person&rsquo;s heels, so by the 1980s and 1990s, computerization of exchanges was rampant. A story&nbsp;documented&nbsp;by Donald MacKenzie in &ldquo;Mechanizing the Merc: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Rise of High-Frequency Trading&rdquo; describes what I believe to be a crucial moment in the transition between human and electronic transactions. After the CME launched E-Mini contracts in 1997, the exchange built a semicircular platform above the pits where the first users of Globex terminals were installed. &ldquo;So was born &lsquo;the bigs and the littles&rsquo;,&rdquo; MacKenzie writes. &ldquo;The arbitrage between the pit- traded S&amp;P 500 future and the E-Mini, a fifth its size. Pairs of traders would collaborate, one in the pit and one sitting above it at a Globex terminal, communicating by hand signals or radio headsets.&rdquo; The old&nbsp;hand signals&nbsp;used by human traders since the 1930s &ndash; known as &ldquo;arbs&rdquo;, they were faster than yelling &ndash; now pointed to the sky, as if intended to draw the attention of Ceres. The new god was not a statue; it was a faceless computer, and Ceres Trading was now a HFT firm.\nAn ex-trader CME S&amp;P 500 pit describes the physical …",
