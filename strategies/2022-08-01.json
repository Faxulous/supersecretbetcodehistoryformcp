If you want simplicity, speed, ease of implementation and a method that has stood the test of time then use Logistic Regression\n2. I'm not sure about including starting odds - you mention form, speed, rating: all of these will already be incorporated into the odds. So it will come down to whether there is any marginal value in your \"own inputs\" over and above the odds\n3. Another downside to starting odds is they are only available when the race starts. Typical setup for a pre-race strategy would be to use the starting odds (implied probabilities) as the target for your model rather than binary win\/loss\n4. I think you're thinking along the right lines with what I'll summarise as \"truncated finishing positions\" although I still think just using the implied probabilities from the starting odds would be way better",
