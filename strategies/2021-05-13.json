I started betting on sports because I wanted to see if I could do it successfully, and it seemed like a fun intellectual space to push myself. Did some tutoring on the side to support myself and never really thought it'd be a full-time thing until suddenly it was. Now I'm trying to get going on betfair profitably in part because I want to diversify\/expand,  but also because it's a cool intellectual challenge. I may end up putting in a ton of work and actually losing money in this piece, or (most likely) making a little bit, but not improving my bottom-line significantly for how much extra work was put in, and I'll be fine with it whatever happens.\n\nIt sounds like some people have had very different paths, but to me you gotta find a thing that you feel a drive\/passion to do, that you enjoy doing at least somewhat for its own sake, and be patient with results. I suppose that also goes along with being honest with yourself about the things you are and aren't good at, although I'd guess passion\/drive will tend to outweigh talent. But yeah, to Mo's point, find the piece that you're enjoying most, and push there. And if there's no part of exploring this space that is enjoyable, I would think it's not worth it.\n\nBut yeah, in terms of practical things, as has been said, I'd emphasize some amount of thinking about things and testing hypotheses on data broadly, rather than overfitting to a sample.",
