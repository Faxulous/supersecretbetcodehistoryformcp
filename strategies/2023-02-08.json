If you have a number of strategies running on the same system and the same betfair account...How do you set the exposures for each strategy independently.\nI currently have this code in a single strategy:\n```strategy = Sub6(\n    name=\"WIN\",\n    market_filter=betfairlightweight.filters.streaming_market_filter(\n        event_type_ids=[\"7\"], # was 7 for horses, 4339 for greyhounds, 15 = todays card greyhounds\n        country_codes=[\"GB\",\"IE\"],\n        market_types=[\"WIN\"],\n    ),```\nWould I change it to something like this:\n```strategy = Sub6(\n    name=\"WIN\",\n    market_filter=betfairlightweight.filters.streaming_market_filter(\n        event_type_ids=[\"7\"], # was 7 for horses, 4339 for greyhounds, 15 = todays card greyhounds\n        country_codes=[\"GB\",\"IE\"],\n        market_types=[\"WIN\"],\n        max_order_exposure=5,\n        max_selection_exposure=20,\n        max_trade_count=5,\n        max_live_trade_count=1\n    ),```\nSo can the exposures be set in the strategy itself rather than in Strategy.py Sorry only basic python skills so i might be talking $%^&amp; Thanks :grinning:",
