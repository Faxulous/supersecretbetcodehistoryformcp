        "text": "can anyone share their experience with greyhounds lately? I have a strat running there thats been making me roughly 150 a day for years. None of my numbers have changed (volume traded is roughly same, EV calculated using prices at off has been stable at roughly 150\/day). Only thing that changed is my pnl, instead of an average of 150\/day i m making -300 a day. Im beating the prices at the off consistently, but somehow that doesnt seem to matter. Its on Forecast market, so odds are high generally (30 runners), so variance is high and i m used to a little bit of a rollercoaster, but generally it would all balance out over a week or at least over the month it would look good, but the losses have been coming in consistenly for 2 months now, which seems to stretch beyond bad luck. Anyone noticed something simular? Positve EV but heavily negative results?",

Normally that is my assumption for calculating EV, but recently it does seem like this assumption is wrong. Normally i felt like the final price is trustworthy, as it should include everyones knowledge at that point. Even if its inaccurate, as long as that is due to a lack of knowledge of the whole market, that is fine aswell, as then noone systemetically gains from that and the misspricings balance out in both directions. Only way i can see the price being systematically wrong is if someone takes a position, but not to the full extend of his knowledge. For example, someone knows for a fact that runner X should be priced at 2, but he only backs when the price is above 4, effectively leaving money in the market that he could be taking",

Normally that is my assumption for calculating EV, but recently it does seem like this assumption is wrong. Normally i felt like the final price is trustworthy, as it should include everyones knowledge at that point. Even if its inaccurate, as long as that is due to a lack of knowledge of the whole market, that is fine aswell, as then noone systemetically gains from that and the misspricings balance out in both directions. Only way i can see the price being systematically wrong is if someone takes a position, but not to the full extend of his knowledge. For example, someone knows for a fact that runner X should be priced at 2, but he only backs when the price is above 4, effectively leaving money in the market that he could be taking"
