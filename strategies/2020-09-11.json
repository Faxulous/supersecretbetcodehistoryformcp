I can see the argument for restricting order types (especially given the way this has played out in US equities microstructure) albeit that I do prefer your definition of FOK to theirs, but the latency point seems little odd given that an API user by default will have the ability to interact at much lower latencies. Nonetheless, I guess applying a 10ms 'speed bump' equally across all users seems fair! Thanks for the extra context you provided elsewhere in the thread around exactly where the speed bump is applied, I hadn't been aware of that.",

I can see the argument for restricting order types (especially given the way this has played out in US equities microstructure) albeit that I do prefer your definition of FOK to theirs, but the latency point seems little odd given that an API user by default will have the ability to interact at much lower latencies. Nonetheless, I guess applying a 10ms 'speed bump' equally across all users seems fair! Thanks for the extra context you provided elsewhere in the thread around exactly where the speed bump is applied, I hadn't been aware of that."
