Sports betting might look similar to financial trading with its fancy graphs but it's very different and to [me] it should be treated very differently. You are correct in saying you need to be wired differently but I do believe it can be learnt assuming you are open to it.\n\nFirst off to make money in sports betting you need to get value, there is no compromise to this, if you are not getting value then you are not going to make money. It doesn't matter if you are market marking, scalping, swing trading, auto betting, manual betting etc. it's mathematically impossible to make money without getting value. Write 'value' on something in front of your computer and anytime you do something think about whether it makes sense to do from a value point of view.\n\nFor example you mention 'hedging', lets say you develop a signal that you believe gets value 60-10mins out from start time at around 2% ROI, unless you are limited by bankroll (I doubt it in sports) there is no planet where randomly crossing the spread in order to hedge is going to make you money long term. It is likely that you will either completely remove that 2% ROI or go negative. Does randomly crossing the spread at post time give me value? No. However assuming you are getting a decent chunk of value in the initial order and hedging allows you to even out your pnl \/ take advantage of as much of your bankroll as possible etc. then I can see its benefits (aka <@ULDAVFDRP>) But this is under the assumption that you know where the value is and you are taking the hit, this second order should not form part of your analysis when trying to find a profitable strategy.\n\nIf you developing an automated strategy that works pre race but find yourself having to filter on race types, fave odds etc. to show a profit then stop. Take a step back, I write a lot of stuff down and simply writing what I am thinking makes me realise that I am an idiot when I come up with daft stuff like race type filters \/ limiting the odds etc. To me this says either back fitting or that my signal is not correctly developed.\n\nI have skimmed your on going thread on BA and the big thing that sticks out to me is your sample size relative to what you are doing coupled with I assume your execution on hedging. I tend not to make any changes or remove strategies until I have at least 1k orders through the market, and at that point I start to analyse [everything] and not just the pnl but matching rates, profit vs trigger \/ odds \/ time to start \/ volume etc. I don't think I have seen you go into this detail on your thread? (I might be wrong)\n\n_I will talk about your latest inplay post next, to be continued.._",

Take a step back, I write a lot of stuff down and simply writing what I am thinking makes me realise that I am an idiot when I come up with daft stuff like race type filters \/ limiting the odds etc. To me this says either back fitting or that my signal is not correctly developed.\n\nI have skimmed your on going thread on BA and the big thing that sticks out to me is your sample size relative to what you are doing coupled with I assume your execution on hedging. I tend not to make any changes or remove strategies until I have at least 1k orders through the market, and at that point I start to analyse [everything] and not just the pnl but matching rates, profit vs trigger \/ odds \/ time to start \/ volume etc. I don't think I have seen you go into this detail on your thread?
