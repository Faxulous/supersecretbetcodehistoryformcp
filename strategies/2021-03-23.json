I'm not really suggesting _'asking for more value'_ I'm talking about only posting bets when there's a stronger signal of value, how much value you ask for is then a separate consideration. That shouldn't give you the adverse selection you're talking about. Say for example your signal was weight of money - there's obviously a range of possible values and you're going to have to make a decision that when WOM &gt; X that's when you bet. So if that's your new bot I'd set X nice and high for a kick off. Obviously that's a very simplistic example but you can apply the same principal to anything you might automate, the decision to bet is essentially binary but there are continuous thresholds underlying it that can be adjusted. This is super simple if you're estimating EV but even if you're not you should be able to identify when your signals are stronger and confine yourself to those opportunities to start with.

I generally fire off a range of bets a few ticks apart to catch any \"overshoot\" and (theoretically) improve my perceived value. Does that seem sensible? That does of course increase my risk, so I'm also curious about how you reduce liabilities, i.e. do you try to balance risk per runner, place bets on both sides (unintentional hedging) or simply let bets ride? It can take a long time for edges to show their true colours, so I'm wondering how you determine what is an acceptable amount to lose when starting a strategy that may take a few thousand bets to settle?",

I generally fire off a range of bets a few ticks apart to catch any \"overshoot\" and (theoretically) improve my perceived value. Does that seem sensible? That does of course increase my risk, so I'm also curious about how you reduce liabilities, i.e. do you try to balance risk per runner, place bets on both sides (unintentional hedging) or simply let bets ride? It can take a long time for edges to show their true colours, so I'm wondering how you determine what is an acceptable amount to lose when starting a strategy that may take a few thousand bets to settle?"

Regards risk: all I do for something new is give a maximum exposure per runner. I set up on a new sub-account and link the maximum liability to the balance. I know that's not available to everyone but anyone can use the same principal. For something experimental I start at £2 bets, £10 max exposure and £200 balance. Yeah I know, last of the big spenders - but if it's good it'll build in no time. As the balance grows I let the liability scale but I leave the stakes until returns stop increasing then I look at staking, and by that time I'll have enough data to look at matching rates and so on. At the start of something new I wouldn't post multiple bets per 'strike' or 'opportunity' or whatever you might call it as that would mean increasing liability without gaining a lot of data - I'd rather keep that liability back and use it for another bet later in the market. The other thing I do with anything new (and established stuff come to that) is structure my betting to generate data, typically that might mean randomising pricing in some sensible range. I think it's really important to focus on getting the data that you'll need in the future even at the cost of a bit of profit now. In the long run that will make you more money. That's how I would approach your thing of bets a few ticks apart, I would spread it over separate strikes as that would generate way more data. Regarding how long it takes an edge to materialise, if you're at moderate odds and you've got a decent bit of margin it doesn't take long at all. Personally I don't go in for anything that's going to take a lot of markets to show a good profit, not that there's anything wrong with that it's just not my style. For the most part I'm firmly a mid-market player, 1.4 to 5 ish. At those odds if you're starting off with minimal stakes and a conservative trigger threshold I would usually expect to be decently ahead after 100 markets. For a newer player that might not be plausible, but I'd raise an eyebrow if you were significantly down after the first 250 markets. Of course you expect some variability, it will come at some point and it MIGHT come the moment you start but it's not that likely to, so if you start off badly it's probably not wise to assume that it's variability.",

I'm not saying it's easy to win - like I said I still start stuff off with £200 after all these years, why do you think that is? I don't see much reason to lose though.

The principals are the same though, just with PO you have less margin and more liquidity whereas with IP it's the other way round. In other words pre-off you can have less edge but you get matched more so it should come out similar(ish). I'm not saying it's easy to win - like I said I still start stuff off with £200 after all these years, why do you think that is? I don't see much reason to lose though. If you research something properly before you start live and check all your reasoning without the blinkers of wishful thinking there's no need for anything to tank."
