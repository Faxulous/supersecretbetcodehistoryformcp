As <@U4H19D1D2> mentioned you do get manipulation on un-withdrawn non runners, but that's something else really. You don't really expect to see money trying to push the market in the way that you do pre-off because price moves are generally caused by events more than sentiment. I would caution you though that WOM looks very different in running to pre off with generally much more available to back than to lay.",
