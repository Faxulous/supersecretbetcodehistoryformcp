If you are a manual trader then for sure some elementary common sense \"psychology\" can be useful. At the end of the day if you don't have some kind of edge that makes you profitable then psychology is meaningless. You can have the most positive mindset in the world and great self discipline but if you have no edge you will end up in the poorhouse regardless. But it's an easy e-book to write (by write I mean copy paste someone else's ebook) and sell to the gullible. In this way they also cover themselves when they sell you their \"trading guide\" or \"course\" as that way they can blame it all on YOUR mindset and discipline when you discover that their shitty methods don't work. This may sound overly cynical but the space is awash with such nonsense.",

If you are a manual trader then for sure some elementary common sense \"psychology\" can be useful. At the end of the day if you don't have some kind of edge that makes you profitable then psychology is meaningless. You can have the most positive mindset in the world and great self discipline but if you have no edge you will end up in the poorhouse regardless. But it's an easy e-book to write (by write I mean copy paste someone else's ebook) and sell to the gullible. In this way they also cover themselves when they sell you their \"trading guide\" or \"course\" as that way they can blame it all on YOUR mindset and discipline when you discover that their shitty methods don't work. This may sound overly cynical but the space is awash with such nonsense."
