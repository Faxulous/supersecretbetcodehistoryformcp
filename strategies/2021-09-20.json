I have identified some market parameters that occur on my most profitable bets. Problem is, when I make the bet placement require those conditions, my number of matched bets goes up substantially relative to those identified bets. Like double. E.g. my backtest shows 600 matched bets as the most profitable within the range of the specified parameters. But when rerun the backtest using those parameters I get 1200 bets matched. Those extra 600 do not add to the profit.\n\nI just don't understand because I putting in parameters that limit the range of circumstances in which a bet is placed. I have even simulated removing all my other bets from the market and it still shows the same behaviour. Just wondering if anyone else has seen this behaviour? I can't understand why my matched bets number goes up when I use the same parameters?? :pleading_face:",
