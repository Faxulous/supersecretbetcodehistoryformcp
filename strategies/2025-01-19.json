        "text": "It's been a frustrating week trying to get `Strategy2` to the point where I'd be comfortable redeploying it\n\nOn Monday I started by increasing the exposure limit on `Strategy1` for in play horses to bring it in line with what I've used for backtesting. I haven't spent much time using backtests to gauge how much I can scale everything up but that's perhaps something to start thinking about\n\nI wasn't planning on doing this but I decided on Monday to also compare `Strategy0`'s live bets to the backtest and discovered some big problems with my execution which meant I'd missed out on - very roughly - about 15,000 bets over the past three months. This was largely down to handling the start of races and using the `marketStartTime`. I've completely overhauled the logic and it appears to have fixed things. I made a separate tweak that should also help reduce the number of missing bets but, checking that now, it's been somewhat less successful\n\nRight, back to `Strategy2`. I've definitely made significant improvements to the model over the past week but none of the changes have translated into a meaningful shift in backtest performance. Intuitively, where the model is strongest it must just be agreeing with the market. However, I did have a small breakthrough last night with the filters I'm applying to try to avoid adverse selection and I think the strategy is just about at the stage where I'm happy to start live testing it again today. I don't think the backtest performance is quite good enough but the thing that convinced me it's worth live testing is that I can run it against many more markets than I have scraped prices for - i.e. all of the `OTHER_PLACE` markets. As in my last update, I can use BSP to quickly assess whether it's actually finding value on those markets. The breakthrough I'm referring to should apply to pretty much any taker strategy so I'm excited to apply it to other strategies\n\nSo the plan for the rest of the day is to manually run the strategy against today's UK racing and I also still owe my syndicates another couple of hours work for the week. Looking to next week, I should fit `Strategy2`'s model to Australian racing and backtest it again to see how that's looking. I do have one other big model improvement on my to-do list that I'll action and a couple of suggestions from o1 that I think are worth exploring but I haven't thought about what's next beyond that. I'll review my list of strategy ideas and have another chat with o1\n\nA couple of general findings from this week:\n\n1. It really helps to step away from the computer. All of my big breakthroughs in thinking came from taking a shower or cooking dinner or walking the dog\n2. o1 continues to be indispensable. It's at least as good as if I had a junior quant working for me\nUpdate on performance:\n\n1. Got rotated back into syndicate strategies yesterday. We've been undertaking a large reconciliation exercise, the end result of which is that I'm quite a bit behind of my share so I imagine I'll be in rotation for a bit now\n2. New strategies had a bad couple of days midweek and have been absolutely crushing it since then\nNew strategies net profit up to 2.3% of existing strategies net profit!",
