In the end money's only useful if it's making your life better, so yeah - why not sacrifice a little to buy a better night's sleep.\n\nAlthough I never hedge I do keep significantly more float in my accounts than is necessary. That's not optimal, I should have that money invested and working for me, but it means I never have to stress about volatility so I take the hit. Same thing really.",
