Several strategies may price up a market very good, i.e. backs get backed in lays get pushed out, but again this leads to a very correlated outcome across all bets. For example I may have backed something, it gets pushed it then runs awful and a horse that hasnt won in years pops up and wins. Its likely that I have layed that horse also, so you get a double hit. is this typically what others see across their bets?",

Bank structure \/ sizes is separate and im not really concerned about return or overly too much about risk. Several strategies may price up a market very good, i.e. backs get backed in lays get pushed out, but again this leads to a very correlated outcome across all bets. For example I may have backed something, it gets pushed it then runs awful and a horse that hasnt won in years pops up and wins. Its likely that I have layed that horse also, so you get a double hit. is this typically what others see across their bets?"

I think it's pretty fun and you can do a lot to get around stuff, but, like I *think* <@UBS7QANF3> said a month or two ago, it's not 1904. I wanna mess with something a bit more fancy\/modern, especially to handle things like non-linearity. I saw Xgboost mentioned here and am wrapping my head around decision trees a bit, they seem cool. Do you guys have other recommendations for things to look at if I'm especially interested in non-linear effects? I hear a lot about neural nets as well, not sure what the pros and cons are. Within decision trees, I'm thinking random forest models seem interesting? Just curious if there's anything else I should be thinking about if I'm looking into non-linear models.",

I saw Xgboost mentioned here and am wrapping my head around decision trees a bit, they seem cool. Do you guys have other recommendations for things to look at if I'm especially interested in non-linear effects? I hear a lot about neural nets as well, not sure what the pros and cons are. Within decision trees, I'm thinking random forest models seem interesting? Just curious if there's anything else I should be thinking about if I'm looking into non-linear models."
