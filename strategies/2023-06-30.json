If the amount of data over the 12 months is large enough of a sample size, that may be enough evidence. Understanding exactly what changed and why can be very helpful as well. Is your strategy more profitable because spreads have changed, or because the market is more erratic? If you can explain the reason why profitability has changed, then there's less reason to pin it on nebulous overfitting."
