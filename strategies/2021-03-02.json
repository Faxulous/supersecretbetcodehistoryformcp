My monetary results are based up correct Rank being selected and a £25 Back bet or £25 Lay bet achieved at BSP. £25 was chosen when I set up my database as a figure that should be able to be matched around the off time. In reality this may not always be the case but this way I have a consistent approach. I am not at the implementation stage yet. Other caveats, I do not consider the odds when Laying. In reality I would not be placing £25 on 1000 BSP even though this might show up as a win in the results however having some visibility on the impact when a high odds Lay goes on to win I`m hoping will give some pointers on frequency and risk reward at the implementation stage. I have shown visibility on Ranks 11 &amp; 12 although they do not feature in the daily total so I can compare the rate of progress to other systems on test. This is what I believe to be the results for Mon assuming my sums\/data is correct. To clarify, getting matched on the correct Rank is more important than any odds changes to the BSP value when getting matched. As a measure of success or failure I count the No of suggestions then the No that have a value &gt;£0.00. New system so thus far Count = 79, CountIF &gt;£0 = 60. I`m hoping that posting here will turn into a bit of a peer review.",

Once shuffled take 20% of you data and put it aside, forget about it for now, almost like it doesn't exist.  With the remaining 80% you will use this data to come up with your model \/ script \/ decision maker. Apply the process of learning to this data solely making sure it never sees any of the 20% hidden away. A typical learning approach could be linear regression (gradient descent) but it can be as simple as using excel to filter records although this is sub optimal. Once you think you have constructed your model \/ script \/ decision maker, return to that 20% of data and apply the rules \/ model to it and evaluate performance.",

Once shuffled take 20% of you data and put it aside, forget about it for now, almost like it doesn't exist.  With the remaining 80% you will use this data to come up with your model \/ script \/ decision maker. Apply the process of learning to this data solely making sure it never sees any of the 20% hidden away. A typical learning approach could be linear regression (gradient descent) but it can be as simple as using excel to filter records although this is sub optimal. Once you think you have constructed your model \/ script \/ decision maker, return to that 20% of data and apply the rules \/ model to it and evaluate performance."

Obviously I soon realised that was a silly idea, since in tennis the future price isn’t governed by historical price movements - future price movements are purely (or mostly) a function of the score!

        "text": "<@U01PQ9SR9MJ> It can be quite difficult to understand what \"value\" is and there is no binary answer to the question. The basic idea of making a profit is to place bets at prices greater than the true probability of an event happening. That could be horse winning a race or a football team losing, etc. The fact is that we never _truly_ know if the bet we are placing is good value or not and all we can do is make our best approximation. If our approximation is correct often enough, we make a profit. Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we get it wrong, but as long as we're right more often than the market, we make a profit. Unlike tossing coins, rolling dice or spinning roulette wheels, sports betting does NOT have probabilities that can be calculated exactly, so at best, we're using educated guesses. Whether intentional or not, strategies like \"lay the favourite\", \"back the outsider\", etc will only show a profit IF they are finding value.\n\nRegarding backtesting, as others have mentioned, you are trying to predict _future_ patterns, so building a strategy using _all_ of your data only tells you what happened in the past. The problem is overfitting, where, through multiple filter adjustments and fine tuning, you end up picking all the sweet spots from events that have already happened. It's no different to shopping...if the item you want to buy is £10 today but was £8 yesterday, you will have to pay £10 for it because yesterday's price has now gone. Your strategy may tell you to buy at £8, but that's no longer available, so it's not a true value. You _can_ build a strategy using _all_ of your data but then you would have to place real bets and wait a long time to see if it's actually profitable. OR you can split the data into a \"training\" set and a \"validation\" set, the validation set representing the \"future\" data. It's critical to ensure that while developing the strategy that you _never_ use the validation data as it's for...you guessed it...validation only.\n\nAfter many years at this game (I was botting <http:\/\/Flutter.com|Flutter.com> via browser emulation before Betfair bought them out in ~2002) I had also become very stuck in my thought process. I have a handful of bots that have earnt small amounts for many years but never enough to actually live off. Joining this Slack group was the best thing I've done in the last 20 years. The quality of knowledge collected here is second to none and the members are more than happy to answer stupid questions (and I've asked a lot of them!).
