My model is performing alright, but much worse than in backtesting(using Jan-may data 2020). Towards the end of that period I see a performance decrease even in backtest(when some leagues started reopening with no crowd?). My training set stops in December 2019. I must do my split along the time axis, otherwise I will surely be leaking. How have other people been dealing with this significant change in base distribution of home\/away wins? Do you have data on crowd attendance, and is that enough to fix it? I don’t like that this whole period should probably be held out when retraining in the future, so I’m building a new model that will predict probabilities relative to baseline win frequencies instead. I can only imagine that this has been debated before, so sorry if I’m reviving a dead topic.",
