Validate idea by doing some basic analysis on summary data eg BSP data\n3. Confirm idea looks good in a backtest, mainly looking at the equity curve (is it up and to the right, how do the drawdowns and other variance characteristics look)\n4. Validate backtest by live trading small stakes and comparing live trading results to backtests on the same events\n5. Scale up stakes in line with live trading performance\n",

        "text": "This one?\n\n&gt;&gt; Michael\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; I honestly think that if you've got what it takes you can start from anywhere and just work until it works. Even if you start with something simple and apparently useless like WOM you can just push and push until you either get to the point where it works or you learn enough to move your understanding on.\n&gt; \n&gt; If WOM was the only idea you had what could you do with it? Could you think of different ways to think about it or compose it? Or imagine all you had was WOM and you couldn't see anything else about the market - could you find a way to price the whole market based on just that? What would that look like?\n&gt; \n&gt; Grinding out any idea however shit is far more likely to bring home the bacon than flitting from one superficially investigated idea to another in the hope that you strike gold on something that other people somehow haven't noticed.\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I don't think ANYONE can do it, most people can't do it, even most smart and seemingly qualified people can't do it, even if they try really hard. Somehow there are just people who can do it and people who can't. It's not the cleverest or the best or the hardest workers who succeed at this, it's just the people who can do it. So don't grind too hard or too long, if this doesn't work there are plenty of better things to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael\n&gt; Yeah I agree. One thing I like to do is just imagine that the thing I'm looking at is the only thing there was and then work through that as a kind of thought experiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael\n&gt; I think I'd add that I don't think there is necessarily a \"correct\" step forwards, and in any case you don't always need to go forwards, I mean backwards isn't great but sideways might be good, at least it's not stasis. It's exploring.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think if I told you the basis of my TPD betting (which I kind of want to but won't) you'd never believe that it would work but it does because I just pushed the idea even though it's basically quite stupid. (edited) \n&gt; \n&gt; Michael\n&gt; My first breakthrough came from imagining that the prices on the exchange were invisible and that I had to figure them out from the volumes offered, matched and so on. I worked out a way to do it and that told me what runner would typically look like at a given price in given market conditions. Then I just looked for any instance where my derived prices where significantly different from the best available prices and bet inside the spread on the discrepancy. Over the course of a few years that clocked up over a million quid and since I was penniless at the start that was just magnificent.\n&gt; \n&gt; The same algorithm isn't nearly as powerful now but I still use it as part of my pricing and as a sense check for a lot of my betting.\n&gt; \n&gt; I've never repeated the exercise because I'm quite lazy and prefer to do other things but if I did it again I bet it would work again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael\n&gt; Yeah  I didn't say it was easy. I don't know what you've done already so you might be in front of this sort of thing, but one of the things I would do is work through what you might expect in theory and then see if it applies in practice. Say for example that you construct a \"toy\" market with three runners all matching at 3, how can they be different in other ways and how might you expect those differences to predict the relative value of each runner? Once you've got an idea of what a runner at 3 \"should\" look like you check that against your data and see if you're right. Don't try to generate bets yet, just see if you can re-price all runners at 3 and see whether in the broadest sense you improved on the market price. Take all the runners at 3 that you made longer - did fewer than 1\/3 of them win? Now you know if you're going the right way so you either keep going or change direction. (edited) \n&gt; \n&gt; ....then you take that understanding, generalise it to all prices and work out some way to build a whole book. Bingo! Congratulations you've completed the easy part. Now you've got to work out optimal execution and that really is hard.",

I don't know what you've done already so you might be in front of this sort of thing, but one of the things I would do is work through what you might expect in theory and then see if it applies in practice. Say for example that you construct a \"toy\" market with three runners all matching at 3, how can they be different in other ways and how might you expect those differences to predict the relative value of each runner? Once you've got an idea of what a runner at 3 \"should\" look like you check that against your data and see if you're right. Don't try to generate bets yet, just see if you can re-price all runners at 3 and see whether in the broadest sense you improved on the market price. Take all the runners at 3 that you made longer - did fewer than 1\/3 of them win? Now you know if you're going the right way so you either keep going or change direction. (edited) "

If someone like <@UBS7QANF3> thinks an idea is a goer then I'll bet it is and it'll just be a question of finding the right strategy for developing it. In that regard I think <@UPMUFSGCR>'s suggestion of just stepping away for a bit to shift one's perspective is a good one.\n\nFor my own part if I have a new idea I'll start by seeing if there's anything in it at all with some very simple test, like does it generate a series of back bets that would produce a profit if they all matched immediately at BATB - whatever's relevant. If I can't find any reason for hope within a couple of hours I'll semi-forget about it and just do a quick write up of what my thinking was and how I tested it so that I can read over it at some future point and maybe think differently about it.\n\nIf I do find that an idea has at least some potential then I'll work on realising if for as long as it maintains my interest, but I rarely spend all that long because I favour getting something up and betting and then digging into the results over a lot of back testing or anything like that. That's a matter of approach though, others will doubtless have their own ways of doing things.\n\nFinally; If I have an idea that I think has legs I basically never give up on it,  if I can't get it working then I just write a break-even version of it, start it going with minimal stakes and forget about it for months on end, even years if I've really forgotten. Eventually I come back to it with fresh eyes and tonnes of data and try again.",

If I can't find any reason for hope within a couple of hours I'll semi-forget about it and just do a quick write up of what my thinking was and how I tested it so that I can read over it at some future point and maybe think differently about it.\n\nIf I do find that an idea has at least some potential then I'll work on realising if for as long as it maintains my interest, but I rarely spend all that long because I favour getting something up and betting and then digging into the results over a lot of back testing or anything like that. That's a matter of approach though, others will doubtless have their own ways of doing things.\n\nFinally; If I have an idea that I think has legs I basically never give up on it,  if I can't get it working then I just write a break-even version of it, start it going with minimal stakes and forget about it for months on end, even years if I've really forgotten. Eventually I come back to it with fresh eyes and tonnes of data and try again."
