If you place a bet with a pre-determined plan to hedge then you guarantee that your hedging bet will have negative expectancy. That's because you are committed to matching it and to get a 100% chance of matching you must be willing to accept a negative expectancy bet. This is why simplistic examples showing that hedging doesn't reduce profits are straightforwardly wrong.\n\nThe larger your bet the worse the proportional expectancy of both your original bet and your hedging bet, so hedging to reduce scary liabilities is usually especially bad.\n\nThere may be circumstances in which you place bets which oppose previous bets because the situation has changed and a runner that was previously value to back is now value to lay, but that's not hedging, that's a different thing.\n\nAlthough the idea of reducing comm might have superficial appeal you'll very likely find that if you calculate total returns in a way that takes account of the loss on your hedging bets you'll end up better off paying the comm on the higher gross profit of the un-hedged bets. You can probably artificially create scenarios where that's not true, but in real world betting it almost always will be.\n\nIf your liability or volatility is too much for you the better course is to reduce your stake. This also increases your average proportional expectancy because you get a better price so in most real world scenarios it makes much more sense than hedging.\n\nSimply put: #nevergreen",
