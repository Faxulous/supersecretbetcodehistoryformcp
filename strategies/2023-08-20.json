You can use any classification algo for the task (logistic regression, random forest, ...). What you said about the fact that there are way more loosers than winners might be very important. This has a name in ML: imbalanced classes. There are multiple ways to address this. One is oversampling, ie, just repeating the minority class (as I think you have done). Another technique is simply putting more importance in the classification of the minority classs. This can be achieved thorugh the  *class_weight = \"balanced\" parameter in RandomForestClassifier*.\n\nAlso, as people have mentionned, be careful with overfitting. The general idea in ML is to split your data in three groups: Train, Validation and Test. You use the train to train the model, the validation to test different hyperparameters, and the test to have an idea of the true accuracy of the model. This is extremely important for hyerparameter tunning in order to avoid overfitting.\n\nAnother important thing it to choose well the metric you are optimising. Just accuracy of the model alone is unlikely to be a good metric, especially if you size your bets based on probability. In that case I would suggest other metrics such as f1-score\/auc.\n\nI am happy to give more help if I can.",
