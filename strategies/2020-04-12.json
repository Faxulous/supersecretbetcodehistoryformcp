My view is the economy is going to tank so I'm not getting involved in any stocks that will be affected by high unemployment and significant drops in income. Next quarter a lot of companies will be showing pretty bad fundamentals. This is much worse than 2008. I'm not a trader either and by horizon is about 30 years. If you're 10-20% off at the beginning, compounding that over years is going to make a massive difference. I dont care what the highs are and the current prices relative to them. Would you call a horse value just because it traded at 25% lower than it's current odds?",
