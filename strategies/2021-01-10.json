The more complex model requires a larger history to exist for each team, and naturally it cuts the tradeable number of events down by about 20%. It's possible that the uncertainty in this 20% is larger, therefore more market innefficiency and higher margins opportunities that the simpler model is able to take advantage of. I'll check the margin on these 20% and see if it massively outweighs the rest"

Some people are into analysing the performance of a strategy as a whole and will test strategy A against strategy B and so on. To me this doesn't make much sense as your strategy is only visible or meaningful to you, the exchange only sees your bets and treats them individually. Personally I like to take my bets independently of whatever triggered them and analyse them that way round."
