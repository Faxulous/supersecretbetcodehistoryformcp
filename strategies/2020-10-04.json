I'm currently using my rather old desktop PC, but had to put a sleep(0.001) in the code due to multiprocessing all 4 cores at 100% which pushed the CPU temperature to 105C and caused a hard shutdown. Obviously the cooling fans (4x80mm &amp; 1x120mm) are not sufficient, but I'm a little reluctant to start upgrading cooling on a machine that is mainly a workstation and is otherwise reliable. I'm wondering if AWS offer anything reasonably priced? Not too bothered about 'fast' backtesting, but would like to be able to run multiple backtest strategies concurrently. Would an AWS micro or lightsail instance be sufficient?",
