First thing I would do is run a simple simulation where you assume that you had 100% of your bets matched at your generated prices Vs actual win\/lose outcomes. That will tell you how your prices compare to real world results and should generate a profit\/loss close to zero if your model is well calibrated.\n\nAssuming the above generates expected results, THEN you can run backtests in Flumine:\n`if betfair_available_price &gt; my_price:\n    side = 'BACK'\nif betfair_available_price &lt; my_price:\n    side = 'LAY'`\nThe Flumine simulation engine will give you a good approximation of which bets will get matched, which ones won't and a simulated \"real world\" profit\/loss which will hopefully be &gt; 0. You should also calculate the \"what if I bet at BSP instead\" profit\/loss, where you replace the simulated matched price with BSP, keeping the matched amount the same. If the BSP performance is better, it's back to the drawing board.\n\nFYI: The above assumes straight betting and no greening\/hedging nonsense.",
