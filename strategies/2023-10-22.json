When it comes to streaming horse markets, I was wondering if there is a way to continually add markets to an strategy (that is already streaming events) as the markets become live?\nThe reason being is I want to set up the strategy at the beginning of the day, and as races become live, I want to add that race to the strategy for processing, and remove it as the race becomes closed or suspended. I can see there’s a `remove_market` method in the `BaseStrategy` but I can’t see an equivalent `add_market`. This suggests that the way it’s supposed to work is that we create the strategy filtering on all the australian horse markets at the beginning of the day and remove them when they’re suspended? There’s also a method called `process_new_market` but is this called when a market becomes live or does this suggest it can be used for what I’m asking?",
