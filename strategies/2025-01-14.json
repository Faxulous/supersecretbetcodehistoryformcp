No price data or market signals involved at all - it is all fundamental modelling using data freely available to anyone. I'm usually of the opinion that models from such data are going to be worthless but I decided to give it a go anyway.\nI've come up with a model that I believe has squeezed as much as it can from the data available. Model summary as follows:\n1. Model built to generate win probabilities for dogs ONLY for A grade races\n2. Model built using data from 2018 to 2023 (inclusive) using classical statistical modelling only\nI've taken the model parameters and using 2024 data have generated some rough numbers to see how well calibrated it is. I've also run a quick and dirty backtest by approximating profit backing to BSP whenever BSP is greated than my model's 0EV price (I realise this step may well be pointless).

This might be OK though as these are graded races where each dog is supposed to be roughly the same current standard.\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n1. Is the model shite and can\/should it be abandoned now based on attached numbers\n2. Assuming no to 1. what is a \"good\" next step to take (e.g. full backtest using highest price traded, full backtest using price X seconds from scheduled start etc.)\n3. Again assuming no to 1. is it \"good enough\" to be worth pursuing with the view to augmenting the dataset with some more obscure\/less easily available data\nA lot of questions here but pre-off fundamental models are new to me.
