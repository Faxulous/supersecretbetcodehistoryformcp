If you think the same people betting on a Tuesday evening at Wolverhampton are the exact same crowd as betting on a Sunday meeting at Naas, you're wrong. Evening racing is a different crowd to weekday afternoon racing, and both are different to weekend racing. Greyhounds - day vs evening are different crowds, different biases. Football is pretty uniform across a league, but EPL betting crowds are fundamentally different to Championship, and definitely different to other leagues in Europe and elsewhere in the World.",

If you think the same people betting on a Tuesday evening at Wolverhampton are the exact same crowd as betting on a Sunday meeting at Naas, you're wrong. Evening racing is a different crowd to weekday afternoon racing, and both are different to weekend racing. Greyhounds - day vs evening are different crowds, different biases. Football is pretty uniform across a league, but EPL betting crowds are fundamentally different to Championship, and definitely different to other leagues in Europe and elsewhere in the World."
