You always need to be mindful of backfitting, in any data you'll find a magic number that somehow 'works' but it won't tell you anything about the future. If the 30s varied dependant on some other concrete market data, time\/vol\/activity level or whatever then it might aquire some validity.  I think you know that though. There's a lot to think about, try to slow it down just a bit and re-read your notebook before making decisions or assumptions. Personally if I have an idea in 5mins I'll spend the next 55 trying to prove it's no good or flawed, you need to be the meanest manager you've ever given work to.
