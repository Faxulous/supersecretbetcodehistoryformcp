You can just assume that ltp == 0EV and bracket that price with offers, you'll certainly be posting value bets. Then your task is to understand in what circumstances you'll get enough noise to get matched at a rate sufficient to overcome adverse selection. Fine - but is that the best you can do? If you can improve your estimate of 0EV you'll do a lot better even if the 'bracketing' is the essence of your strategy.",

You can just assume that ltp == 0EV and bracket that price with offers, you'll certainly be posting value bets. Then your task is to understand in what circumstances you'll get enough noise to get matched at a rate sufficient to overcome adverse selection. Fine - but is that the best you can do? If you can improve your estimate of 0EV you'll do a lot better even if the 'bracketing' is the essence of your strategy."
