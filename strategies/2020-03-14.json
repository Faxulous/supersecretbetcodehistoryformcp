        "text": "<@UUCD6P13J>, I suspect you’re not getting much of a response because the question is way bigger than it looks. But I’ll bite … though I’m not sure you’ll find the answer very helpful!\n\nI can only answer for myself, but I doubt I’m unusual, in saying that it’s both of the above and with way more nuance.\n\nPre-match predictions, basic or otherwise, aka fundamental analysis, can be useful for spotting where the market is getting it wrong. Most markets will start off a bit away from “fair odds” and work their way towards them as the market comes together - though as Liam has pointed out elsewhere, even then they’re not perfect then and money can still be made at starting prices.\n\nOftentimes the aim is not to use fundamental analysis to guess the event’s outcome, but simply to anticipate how the market is likely to move and then exit before the event starts, e.g. can you spot a set of circumstances where the favourite is habitually overbet.\n\nOther strategies may ignore the fundamentals and simply look at what’s happening in the market, aka technical analysis or charting. So for example from the history of matched prices I might look for upper and lower bounds, aka resistance and support prices and trade pre-event between these extremes.\n\nYet another class of strategies uses the prices in one market, often WIN or MATCH_ODDS, to make inferences about related markets and trade on inconsistencies.\n\nOther strategies will use fundamental and technical analysis, for example in-play soccer strategies will take note of how the market is moving with time decay and balance that against the probability of certain events (primarily goals) occurring based on information from matches with similar features.\n\nSo overall, it’s a big it depends and is one of the factors that makes this goal so interesting and creates so much space for wildly different approaches.\n\nGiven that, in the search for your first profitable strategy, I’d recommend that you dig where you feel most comfortable. Whichever of those two high level approaches calls loudest to you, there’s a profitable strategy waiting for you to discover it.",
