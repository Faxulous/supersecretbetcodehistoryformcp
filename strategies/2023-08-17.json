I noticed something unexpected (to me, at least!).\n\nIf a bettor has two selections with expected positive value, they could calculate the Kelly stakes individually, as if the two bets were independent of each other, and place both bets. It might be a bit naive to do this, but of course it can be done. Let's call the wrongly-assumed-independent-Kelly stakes for the two runners: a1, and b1.\n\nThen instead, if a bettor goes onto that website and uses the Kelly calculator for two bets using Exclusive Outcomes, they will be returned different (correct) Kelly stakes; we can call them a2 and b2.\n\nI have been playing around comparing a1 with a2, and b1 with b2. To my surprise, I noticed that a2 &gt; a1, and of course b2 &gt; b1 also.\n\nIt seems that the conclusion is: if you have two selections with positive edge, you should bet MORE on each of them compared with if you had only had one selection. To me, that sounds counter-intuitive. Can anyone explain why this is?",
