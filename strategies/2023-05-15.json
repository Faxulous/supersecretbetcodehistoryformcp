If price action based, you might need 10k+ examples, but you could have tens or hundreds of examples per event. However, I think it’s worth pointing out that regardless there are not many 2yo 5f events, or 4m Hcap Chase events, or races with pre-off fav below 1.2 or higher than 7.0, and the fundamentals and price action - even pre-event - are going change over all the spaces in between. I think I’d want a large enough sample space across all those dimensions, and so you get closer to 10k events - about 2.5 years of racing.",
