What I would suggest is to use this ability to parse the data files to gather statistics rather than run full backtests. From there, you may find some useful patterns, upon which you could run a few backtests to prove they work as a strategy. And then.... assuming that you've done all of the above and backtests show that your ideas are sensible, you can port the Flumine strategy to live betting, which will give you \"real world\" data to analyse.",
