You'll have a good mix of -EV to +EV bets to work with and not too many strategy changes to confound your analysis. I'm a big believer in working with your bets and refining\/developing what you have - you'll have a potential treasure trove of new ideas hidden in the learning you can take from your betting history.\n\nYou've got routes in too - let's say you know that you do better in AUS markets (for example) well why? Ok you might say it's thinner volume but that's not really the answer - why exactly does that make a difference? There must be some market characteristic that is more common in those AUS markets that's making the difference. Is it wider spreads? Is it that more of your bets match as offers? Something to do with differential match rates at different odds? Something else? What is it? If you can identify that you'll understand your betting much better and you're sure to be able to develop new approaches from what you find. For an easy start you could find the niches in UK racing that share that critical characteristic and you could cut out all the junk bets where those circumstances don't pertain. Ditching your bad bets is always the lowest fruit.\n\nQuite often people who've had small scale success* either don't understand WHY their strategies make money or they think they understand but they're wrong. That's the key to greater success - (well one of the possible keys). If you can unlock the mechanisms that have returned your profit the the doors really open.\n\n*I don't know you so please forgive me if I'm miss-describing you, I'm just going by my sense from your posts and I mean no dis-respect, small success is far more than the vast majority achieve.",

                                "text": ", if you've been running a relatively low margin strategy without many changes on a lot of markets you should have a great data set. You'll have a good mix of -EV to +EV bets to work with and not too many strategy changes to confound your analysis. I'm a big believer in working with your bets and refining\/developing what you have - you'll have a potential treasure trove of new ideas hidden in the learning you can take from your betting history.\n\nYou've got routes in too - let's say you know that you do better in AUS markets (for example) well why? Ok you might say it's thinner volume but that's not really the answer - why exactly does that make a difference? There must be some market characteristic that is more common in those AUS markets that's making the difference. Is it wider spreads? Is it that more of your bets match as offers? Something to do with differential match rates at different odds? Something else? What is it? If you can identify that you'll understand your betting much better and you're sure to be able to develop new approaches from what you find. For an easy start you could find the niches in UK racing that share that critical characteristic and you could cut out all the junk bets where those circumstances don't pertain. Ditching your bad bets is always the lowest fruit.\n\nQuite often people who've had small scale success* either don't understand WHY their strategies make money or they think they understand but they're wrong. That's the key to greater success - (well one of the possible keys). If you can unlock the mechanisms that have returned your profit the the doors really open.\n\n*I don't know you so please forgive me if I'm miss-describing you, I'm just going by my sense from your posts and I mean no dis-respect, small success is far more than the vast majority achieve."
