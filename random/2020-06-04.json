I remember reading something about them discouraging just following the best pros as that's not the service they're trying to offer; I think it's something along the lines of you'll only see the details of the pro's history if you want the opportunity to lay the bet and they will keep track of the times when you were offered to lay a bet and didn't take it.

Essentially it’s letting (or aiming to let) professionals back at bookie odds, and aiming to get punters to lay those odds, but with the hope that there are enough matched bettors who will hedge that lay by backing at the bookies with equivalent odds (which the pros couldn’t do themselves because they’re already limited). \n\nNow the question is whether there is enough lay money from punters, but also whether pros can still win backing at bookie odds but also paying a commission. \n\nAlso I’m not sure what’s stopping a pro from signing up as a punter to lay bets at 0% comm instead. Alternatively as a punter you’d just follow the best pros backs by copying at the bookies and forget laying on Betconnect. (I guess you’d get limited like the pro eventually)\n\nDisclaimer: I haven’t read all the FAQs yet. That’s just my initial take. \n\nWhat’s your take on it <@UBS7QANF3> ?",
