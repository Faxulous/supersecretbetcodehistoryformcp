The TLDR is basically:\n\n_Betfair betting volumes are in decline over recent years, could this lead to BFSP becoming less accurate?_\n\nI am asking this as much to fill gaps in my own knowledge and understanding, but AFAIK, the whole CLV premise is based upon prices converging to probability X at time of event start because of information flow over time and sharper players exploiting value when it presents itself (I am guessing this is analogous to market efficiency hypothesis in finance??). So IF we were to show that BFSP was STILL just as accurate 5 years ago as it was now, could you effectively deduce that it is only \"dumb\" money that is abandoning the markets? If you actually wanted to measure the efficiency of BFSP and its fluctuation over time, what statistical approaches could you use? I know people use brier score to rate probabilistic forecasts so could you use something like this split over a time partition and compare? Up to know, I've not really cared much about CLV as I exclusively bet IP where it is not really applicable. Similarly, I've not been much bothered with measuring my edge (until recently never even bothered calculating ROI until a discussion on here with someone) and just let profit be the measure (I don't lose sleep if Joseph Buchdahl labels me a victim of survivorship bias). But I want to move into pre-off horses and so been thinking more and more about BFSP and the recent drop in volume topic got me thinking about this. I often hear that BFSP is \"accurate on average\" but never seen any hard numbers and certainly never an analysis of its accuracy change over time.",
