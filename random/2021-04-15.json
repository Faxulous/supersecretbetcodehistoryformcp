There are examples of data which are publicly available, such as on sites such as <http:\/\/WhoScored.com|WhoScored.com>, which are both highly detailed and not really usable without extensive scraping and data transformation. You don't have to make such scraping code publicly available (although you would need to include it as part of your submission so the judging panel can - in principle - run it themselves to reproduce your predictions exactly) so you can still gain a significant edge over other entrants even with the public availability requirement\n2. I've included a link to StatsBomb free data (<https:\/\/github.com\/statsbomb\/open-data>) in the README which is highly detailed, ball-by-ball data. For developing a betting strategy this free data is probably not very useful as you would need access to data going forward but the free data includes the last World Cup which is highly relevant to the competition. In other words, data which is of relatively low value generally can actually be of high value for the purposes of this competition",
