When Andrew came over to our table - our MD played bridge with Andrew so that was the connection. He was working the tent with some underlings, and before they all left our table, Andrew asked me what we fancied in the next race. Our selection was trading 20's so they all gave me a little smile and nod that you could easily read, \"Good luck with that!\".\n\nThe race went off - I wasn't watching, I was already looking at the next race. But then the MD starting shouting, \"Go on!\" and then our Chairman, \"Get in there!!\" so I had to look up and watch our selection come up the hill and win. Andrew came over and congratulated us. And his underlings asked me every race afterwards for our selection.",
