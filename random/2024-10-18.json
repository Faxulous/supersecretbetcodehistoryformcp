And as there are lots of differing amounts of information that certain subsets have access to, the approximations are (very likely) very different to each other. It's an extreme case but a jockey who decides to throw a race and not tell anyone else effectively ensures that the probability that the horse wins is zero. We are all churning data to identify the outcome probabilities but the jockey's info is superior to everone else's. Of course as a human, he\/she may subsequently change their mind about throwing the race up to a point at which it becomes too late. But there is just some information we can't ever have access to and so our models are always inaccurate (isn't there some quote along the lines of all models are incorrect but some models are useful). But the probability remains precise.\nI've always thought of it along quantum mechanical lines where each eigenstate probability can vary over time up until the measurement is made (result has it's outcome) at which point state vector collapses onto the eigenstate represented by the observed value (projection postulate I think it was called?)\nAs people who build models, all we can do is approximate based on repeated measurement data from similar historic events? The probabilities are always precise - it's just we can't ever know for sure how far away our approximations are and we have to rely on longer term averages to show that prices\/ implied probabilities match up with observed data frequencies.\n\nI've had some beer and I feel I may regret this post in the morning.",
