I am trying to get my head around edge cases like the following example:\n1. You place a bet inply with async flag\n2. Response comes back with PENDING state.\n3. Market suspends before the inplay delay elapses which would be a failed bet under sync bet placement conditions.\nWhat happens here? Zero order stream update for this bet or some kind of response with the customer order ref and a null bet ID or similar that allows you to determine the failure?\nEssentially I am asking if we can rely on order strem 100% or if best practice for using async is to have some call or listCurrentOrders in addition for any bets that slip through the net (if that is possible).",
