In a simple example of a 2 selection event, this is how I see things working (please correct if nonsense). We start on an empty order book, I offer to back selection A at 80.0 for £1. This results in a virtual £79 @ 1.01 available to back on selection B and a real £1 available to lay at 80.0 on selection A. Someone decides to take the worse value on offer and backs selection B at 1.01 for £79. Disregarding commission, if A wins, I win £79 and they lose £79. If B wins, I lose £1 and they win 79p and Betfair pocket the extra 21p.\n\nMy first question is, how does this matching of orders end up represented to us in terms of traded volume amounts? The 1.01 is virtual, the 80.0 is real. Do we see a traded volume of £1 at 80 on A and £80 at 1.01 on B (despite the 1.01 not being a \"real\" order) ?\n\nSecondly, if the above were repeated in a mature market, such that there was already money available to back selection B at 2.0 and I place the same back on A at 80.0 (way above current best available displayed price) does the cross matching still happen (i.e. would extra volume appear as a virtual 1.01 back price on B) or would it be ignored because a much better price is available already. I suppose I am asking does XM just get implemented when the ladder is thin to try and reduce the spread, or does it happen for ALL orders submitted to the market.",
