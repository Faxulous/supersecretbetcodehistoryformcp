I'm on the mortgage but I am registered \"unemployed\" - because it is true. Solicitor was satisfied with a year bank statements, and copies of the recently added \"My Profit and Loss\" pages on the website. Also they wanted as much of the deposit\/withdrawal account statment info that I could give them.\nI expected a bit of a nightmare but in truth it was very straightforward. Might have been worse had I not been registered unemployed but I'll never know now."
