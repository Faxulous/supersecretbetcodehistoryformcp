I think this is where my mental block is. It just feels strange to be betting without knowing what price you will get. But if you've established situations where you know\/suspect that regardless of what you end up with, it will be +EV then I see the appeal. Now I can just wrap my brain up in knots trying to think about how you would go about that problem.",

I think this is where my mental block is. It just feels strange to be betting without knowing what price you will get. But if you've established situations where you know\/suspect that regardless of what you end up with, it will be +EV then I see the appeal. Now I can just wrap my brain up in knots trying to think about how you would go about that problem."
