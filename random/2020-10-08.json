        "text": "`Why hedging at negative EV is optimal - a rebuttal`\n_Including math for <@UGV299K6H>’s delectation_\n\nImagine the following scenario:\n\n• You have backed a selection pre-event at odds of 2.0\n• Your model gave the fair probability as 52% (and it's right)\n• You calculate the Kelly fraction to be 4% of your bankroll\n• But you're sensible and are using half Kelly so you actually bet 2% of your bankroll\nThe match goes in-play:\n\n• Unfortunately, your selection performs poorly and the odds move against you\n• The best lay on your selection is now 3.0\n• Your model gives the fair probability as 33.5% (and it's right)\n• This means laying the selection has an EV of -0.5%\n• The optimal Kelly stake given your existing position is approximately 1% of your bankroll!\n• Kelly is telling you to hedge at negative EV! :scream:\n• Again, you're sensible so you actually bet the half Kelly stake of 0.5%\nApplication of Bayes theorem gives us the probability that your selection hits odds of 3 as 0.72180 (5 d.p.) so we can work out that your selection wins without ever hitting odds of 3 as 0.27820.\n\nNow let's simulate this, generating 10,000 runs of 10,000 successive bets each. We'll do this for both hedging and no hedging:\n\n```no_hedge_bets = np.random.choice([1.02, 0.98], size=(10000, 10000), p=[0.52, 0.48])\nhedge_bets = np.random.choice([1.02, 1.01, 0.985], size=(10000, 10000), p=[0.278195489, 0.241804511, 0.48])\n\nno_hedge_cumulative_bank = np.cumprod(no_hedge_bets, axis=0)\nhedge_cumulative_bank = np.cumprod(hedge_bets, axis=0)\n\nprint(np.median(no_hedge_cumulative_bank[9999,:]))\nprint(np.median(hedge_cumulative_bank[9999,:]))```\n```403.69789599466213\n739.0367526793249```\nThe _median_ terminal bank of the hedging strategy is 83% larger than no hedging.",
