But ultimately we do things we know we shouldn't or that will have a negative impact and ultimately that lies with the individual. Having said all that, if I were to place blame anywhere I would place it with credit card companies. Obviously it is very specific to my case, but the way these companies make it so so easy to just borrow more is disgraceful. Not sure if it still happens now, but every time I would near my credit limit, the companies would increase it by a couple of grand - without notice and not at my request. It is a complex setup because if I were not already heavily gambling to reduce my debt, I would never have made use of that extra credit and so the situation just got worse and worse until I reached the point of saying enough was enough. Strangely, it was taking out a Wonga payday loan that provided the biggest wake up call and I got myself straight after that point (after several years).\nThe strangest thing for me though is that the only issue I would have was with RNG games - never with sports betting and it really irks me that the UKGC refuse to distinguish between these types of betting. That said, many are able to play them for entertainment and suffer no problems at all so it really is a complicated issue.",

But ultimately we do things we know we shouldn't or that will have a negative impact and ultimately that lies with the individual. Having said all that, if I were to place blame anywhere I would place it with credit card companies. Obviously it is very specific to my case, but the way these companies make it so so easy to just borrow more is disgraceful. Not sure if it still happens now, but every time I would near my credit limit, the companies would increase it by a couple of grand - without notice and not at my request. It is a complex setup because if I were not already heavily gambling to reduce my debt, I would never have made use of that extra credit and so the situation just got worse and worse until I reached the point of saying enough was enough. Strangely, it was taking out a Wonga payday loan that provided the biggest wake up call and I got myself straight after that point (after several years).\nThe strangest thing for me though is that the only issue I would have was with RNG games - never with sports betting and it really irks me that the UKGC refuse to distinguish between these types of betting. That said, many are able to play them for entertainment and suffer no problems at all so it really is a complicated issue."
