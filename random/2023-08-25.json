                "text": "A scoring rule is a function of a probabilistic forecast and a corresponding\noutcome that is used to evaluate forecast performance. A wide range of scoring\nrules have been defined over time and there is some debate as to which are the\nmost appropriate for evaluating the performance of forecasts of sporting\nevents. This paper focuses on forecasts of the outcomes of football matches.\nThe ranked probability score (RPS) is often recommended since it is `sensitive\nto distance', that is it takes into account the ordering in the outcomes (a\nhome win is `closer' to a draw than it is to an away win, for example). In this\npaper, this reasoning is disputed on the basis that it adds nothing in terms of\nthe actual aims of using scoring rules. A related property of scoring rules is\nlocality. A scoring rule is local if it only takes the probability placed on\nthe outcome into consideration. Two simulation experiments are carried out in\nthe context of football matches to compare the performance of the RPS, which is\nnon-local and sensitive to distance, the Brier score, which is non-local and\ninsensitive to distance, and the ignorance score, which is local and\ninsensitive to distance. The ignorance score is found to outperform both the\nRPS and the Brier score, casting doubt on the value of non-locality and\nsensitivity to distance as properties of scoring rules in this context.",

But how about a tennis match of indeterminate duration? Similarly, how about uniformity of model performance with respect to time? I guess I am not expecting any answers, but every time I try to analyse things in a statistically sound manner I am always just left scratching my head when it comes to inplay.\n\nAs you say Mo, one prediction per event makes everything more simple but in truth I don't know where to start when it comes to open ended IP stuff."
