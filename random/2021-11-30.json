The X5675 has 11,616\n\nThe 3950x has 39,170.\n\nSo I paid 19.36 per passmark on the old Dell.\n24.48 per passmark on the more modern machine. Passmark is a crude benchmark. But in terms of running Flumine backtesting on multiple cores, the modern machine is 2.5-3 times faster. So both machines had comparable bang per buck.\n\nHowever, the older Dell runs into heating issues and I can't run it for a long time before it thermal throttles. It's a tangle of cables in there, so I'm not confident of repasting the CPU."
