Racing in Ireland and the UK was suspended last month, leading to a 32% slump in revenue since the ban was imposed, Flutter said on Friday.\n\nThe company said last month it could take a hit of up to ?110m to earnings if sports fixing restrictions due to the coronavirus remain in place until the end of August. It generated about 78% of its revenues through bets placed on global sporting events.\n\nFlutter last week said said its final dividend would be paid out in shares rather than cash as it sought to bolster its finances in the face of the pandemic. The company had planned to pay 133p a share.\n\nFlutter has seen its share price slump by 25% as sports fixtures were cancelled and the government imposed a lockdown forcing the closure of non-essential shops.",
