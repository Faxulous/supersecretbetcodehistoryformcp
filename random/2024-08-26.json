Researchers found that foals with higher gut bacterial diversity at one month old were less likely to develop respiratory diseases and performed better in races up to three years old. Conversely, antibiotic exposure in the first month reduced microbial diversity, increased disease risk, and negatively impacted racing success. These findings highlight the importance of early gut health in determining long-term outcomes.\n\nFor more details, you can read the full article here: <https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-024-64657-6>",
