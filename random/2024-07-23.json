We collected per game statistics for players during their second year, drafted during the years 1999 up to 2006, for which, information on their career longetivity is known. By feeding these statistics of the sophomore players into statistical and machine learning algorithms we select the important statistics and manage to accomplish a satisfactory predictability performance. Further, we visualize the effect of each of the selected statistics on the estimated probability of staying in the league for more than 10 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zoom link: <https:\/\/uoc-gr.zoom.us\/j\/88659969718?pwd=g6bjYPDCuUQo1bzVxjjbgQL4xFN1f3.1|https:\/\/uoc-gr.zoom.us\/j\/88659969718?pwd=g6bjYPDCuUQo1bzVxjjbgQL4xFN1f3.1>",
