HFT made billions because they took the jobs of 1000s of floor traders making pretty fat salaries ripping people off. Only they make a lot less per trade, like 1000x less. The dark pool stuff was dodgy though, but in my opinion the blame lies on the banks for selling out their customers, big surprise.",

HFT made billions because they took the jobs of 1000s of floor traders making pretty fat salaries ripping people off. Only they make a lot less per trade, like 1000x less. The dark pool stuff was dodgy though, but in my opinion the blame lies on the banks for selling out their customers, big surprise."
