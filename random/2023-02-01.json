Once you have the thing setup (Pycharm, etc) the experience is not much different to any other OS. My main advice would be to ensure you research the installation process for any software you need as there's usually a specific Apple Silicon version. The default Intel versions _will_ install OK but I've had \"wrong architecture\" issues in the past, particularly with python\/numpy\/pandas while running in Pycharm.
