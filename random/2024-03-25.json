Once you've got that in place you can go back and look at your other variables and see if they predict profit, if they don't then you ditch them. That way you can continually drive up your margin without your volume trending towards zero.\n\nI'd have to say that I don't think reducing profit volatility is a goal in itself as it will mostly come down to the odds you're betting at.
