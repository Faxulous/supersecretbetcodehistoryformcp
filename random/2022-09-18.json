WIN, PLACE) and lets say there are 500 markets on each, presumably you would just have 1 connection and not worry about it.\n\nBut if say there are 4000 markets in total, split evenly as 2000 for each (I know that's unrealistic for these two market types, but I'm just using those as an example), is there any benefit in splitting things out across multiple connections (E.g. WIN on connection 1 and PLACE on connection 2), or does it simply not matter (i.e. all that matters is what you actually do in terms of processing, how many markets per connection is not really relevant compared to the number of markets overall).",

WIN on connection 1 and PLACE on connection 2), or does it simply not matter (i.e. all that matters is what you actually do in terms of processing, how many markets per connection is not really relevant compared to the number of markets overall)."
