Will most of the people signing up for this course be seasoned professionals looking for that one tiny insight or bit of inspiration? I suspect not. I don't doubt that the vast bulk of the content is available for free here or elsewhere and most of the rest for the cost of a book. Given that we have so many people now on this channel, most of whom must surely be relative beginners I think it's worth pointing that out. I don't know anything about most of the people involved in this particular course and they do seem a bit more credible than some of what we see, but I can't imagine myself recommending it to anyone, especially if it's going to cost them a months salary.",

Will most of the people signing up for this course be seasoned professionals looking for that one tiny insight or bit of inspiration? I suspect not. I don't doubt that the vast bulk of the content is available for free here or elsewhere and most of the rest for the cost of a book. Given that we have so many people now on this channel, most of whom must surely be relative beginners I think it's worth pointing that out. I don't know anything about most of the people involved in this particular course and they do seem a bit more credible than some of what we see, but I can't imagine myself recommending it to anyone, especially if it's going to cost them a months salary."
