With that in place why shouldn't you just work out the probability of your three outcomes (win, refund, lose) and sum the expectation of all three? The probability of winning is included within the probability of placing, can the probability of winning simply be deducted from the probability of placing to get the probability of placing but not winning? I think so, but I might be missing something. <@UBS7QANF3> could straighten that out if I'm wrong.",
