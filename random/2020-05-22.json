I know we can get around by placing a minimum bet at a price that won't get matched (instantly at least, like 1000) and then editing the bet to the size we want. Would the following workflow make sense to you?\n1. Get the list of instructions to be done (for example when computing a cashout, there will be a list of instructions per traded runner)\n2. From the list above, extract the instructions which need the workaround (below minimum bet size). So now we have 2 instruction lists\n3. Make 2 calls to the place orders in parallel\n4. Make a call to replaceOrders with the betIds that need the workaround\n5. Wrap the results on a single entity",

It tells the story ofÂ Navinder Singh Sarao, a UK based day trader who traded the stock market from a standing start (from his bedroom) to amass a fortune of ~Â£70m!..and then supposedly loose it...\nEnjoyed reading it, although a large proportion of the book is centred on the regulatory side of things.\nSome soundbites I took:Â \n\n- Nav was sell taught\n- His strategy was a simple scalping technique, by placing orders out of the money (on what we class as the back side), to skew the weight of money to give the appearance that sellers were in the market. Ie to push the price down. Tactics that are used on Betfair every day (probably by a few of us on here :-)\n- He ended up using a standard platform âTrading Technologiesâ (TT) and had some additional features programmed in by a software engineer at TT. He subsequently had a guy from Edge Technologies to further enhance those features and add a couple more (to take on the HFTâs)\n- He wasnât 100% on auto. Rather,Â he traded manually with these extra âweaponsâ as he describes it\n- He didnât write any of his own code\n- At his peak he was making upto Â£900K\/Day\n- He never spent anything! (Think he treated himself to a new bike and the odd McDonalds:-)\n- He attributed his success to his pattern recognition and fast reactions, the numbers dont lie, so can you doubt it?\n\nIf anything I think the book tried to paint a picture of his character, that I didnât quite like. A bit of a dis service to him IMO. He is obviously a clever guy and its not always possible to determine intelligence or judge someone on how they come across that is perhaps different to the norm.\nI dont think this will lend itself to a film\/movie (Unlike The Big Short), However, it does make a good story and especially to us on here as a glimpse of the art of the possible!!",

                "text": "Evening Folks,\nI mentioned on this channel a few weeks ago that a new book was due out called Flash Crash by Liam Vaughan. It tells the story ofÂ Navinder Singh Sarao, a UK based day trader who traded the stock market from a standing start (from his bedroom) to amass a fortune of ~Â£70m!..and then supposedly loose it...\nEnjoyed reading it, although a large proportion of the book is centred on the regulatory side of things.\nSome soundbites I took:Â \n\n- Nav was sell taught\n- His strategy was a simple scalping technique, by placing orders out of the money (on what we class as the back side), to skew the weight of money to give the appearance that sellers were in the market. Ie to push the price down. Tactics that are used on Betfair every day (probably by a few of us on here :-)\n- He ended up using a standard platform âTrading Technologiesâ (TT) and had some additional features programmed in by a software engineer at TT. He subsequently had a guy from Edge Technologies to further enhance those features and add a couple more (to take on the HFTâs)\n- He wasnât 100% on auto. Rather,Â he traded manually with these extra âweaponsâ as he describes it\n- He didnât write any of his own code\n- At his peak he was making upto Â£900K\/Day\n- He never spent anything! (Think he treated himself to a new bike and the odd McDonalds:-)\n- He attributed his success to his pattern recognition and fast reactions, the numbers dont lie, so can you doubt it?\n\nIf anything I think the book tried to paint a picture of his character, that I didnât quite like. A bit of a dis service to him IMO. He is obviously a clever guy and its not always possible to determine intelligence or judge someone on how they come across that is perhaps different to the norm.\nI dont think this will lend itself to a film\/movie (Unlike The Big Short), However, it does make a good story and especially to us on here as a glimpse of the art of the possible!!",

Sounds like he escaped a criminal conviction but may still end up with a civil penalty. It seems very unfair for him to be charged for writing software that _could_ be used to spoof. His defence argued that it would be the same as, for example, charging a mobile phone retailer for selling drugs when one of their phones was used to facilitate that and I would agree. ",
