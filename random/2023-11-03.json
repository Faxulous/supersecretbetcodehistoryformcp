Now uses a Rust optimiser by default which is about twenty times faster than the original Python code\n2. By default will now just return the implied probabilities which should make calling code more concise\n3. You can now pass in a mapping from identifier to odds and get back a mapping from identifier to probability which also has the potential to significantly simplify calling code",
