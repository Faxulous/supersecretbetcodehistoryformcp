I've a question about the use of thread pools really. At times I will need to place bets across many distinct strategies in a way that they are all fired within as little as 1 millisecond of eachother. This causes the component I use a few problems the result being that my requests are queued in an opaque manner and I suffer placement latency.\n\nWhen using a thread pool I'm trying to find out what the lay of the land is. Alternatively, if I write my own thread pool trying to find a best practice implementation based around the betfair API:\n\n1. Does each thread in the pool maintain a HTTPS connection to the server (in the keep-alive sense) at all times so that when called up it is ready to immediately transmit the request, or does it sit idle and go through the whole SSL handshake process every time?\n2. Are threads created at the start of the program and persist until it terminates? I am guessing this is the case due to overheads in firing up new threads in an on-demand manner?\n3. Within each thread, is a \"global\" session token shared across the entire application, or does each thread make a separate login and manage its own connection? If the latter, is that frowned upon by betfair (do they have a limit on the number of active sessions each user account can make)?\nI am a bit of a dunce with how HTTPS works under the surface and I am trying to get some support for the components I am using but the CS reps are all but accusing me of trying to create something that causes a DOS on a target so I'm getting nowhere (other than getting pissed off with them). When mentioning that I might want to fire off several requests to a server within a single figure millisecond time interval I am being told that my use case is \"very unusual\" and they are proving to be very unhelpful.",
