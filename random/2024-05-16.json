                "text": "We develop a large-scale deep learning model to predict price movements from limit order book (LOB) data of cash equities. The architecture utilises convolutional filters to capture the spatial structure of the limit order books as well as LSTM modules to capture longer time dependencies. The proposed network outperforms all existing state-of-the-art algorithms on the benchmark LOB dataset [1]. In a more realistic setting, we test our model by using one year market quotes from the London Stock Exchange and the model delivers a remarkably stable out-of-sample prediction accuracy for a variety of instruments. Importantly, our model translates well to instruments which were not part of the training set, indicating the model's ability to extract universal features. In order to better understand these features and to go beyond a \"black box\" model, we perform a sensitivity analysis to understand the rationale behind the model predictions and reveal the components of LOBs that are most relevant. The ability to extract robust features which translate well to other instruments is an important property of our model which has many other applications.",

That being said regression is like concrete or steel and probably is the final arbiter of what goes in a forecast.\n\nAlso ridge + features are a lot handier for transfer learning. If you moved to a new market with little historical data you’d feel pretty confident just copying stuff across. Would be easier to manipulate and remove features (weight = 0) without the required data in the new market than trying to break apart a web of neural network shenanigans.
