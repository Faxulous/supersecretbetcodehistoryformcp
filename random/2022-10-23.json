Apart from the fact that he may soon be suspended from Parliament, nothing has changed since he was forced out of his job 3 months ago. It would be like a company sacking an MD for gross incompetence\/dishonesty, and then deciding to give the person another chance!\n\nThat said, there is a perception in some circles that he is a vote winner and a traditional Tory (even though there is little evidence of either of those things!). And the fact that 76 MPs have already backed him makes me think he could well get over the line.\n\nI've only put a tiny bet on. I would guess that £4.7 million markets generally aren't too far away from the true odds!",

Apart from the fact that he may soon be suspended from Parliament, nothing has changed since he was forced out of his job 3 months ago. It would be like a company sacking an MD for gross incompetence\/dishonesty, and then deciding to give the person another chance!\n\nThat said, there is a perception in some circles that he is a vote winner and a traditional Tory (even though there is little evidence of either of those things!). And the fact that 76 MPs have already backed him makes me think he could well get over the line.\n\nI've only put a tiny bet on. I would guess that £4.7 million markets generally aren't too far away from the true odds!"
