I've noticed several kinds of traded volume reductions happen I know that this can occur when they do currency exchange rate adjustments and market traded volumes can be altered due to nonrunners getting pulled and the adjustment factor being applied. In such cases I am noticing that there is no \"ltp\" field sent within the stream update on that runner. It appears logical to assume that we can treat a stream update as a market adjustment rather than a market change if there is no LTP sent (i.e. if \"real\" volumes traded this delta, the LTP would be expected). But you could also argue that if the NEW delta LTP is the same as the LTP before the new delta then it would NOT be sent, invalidating the previous logic.  How do people go about identifying changes that are purely market adjustments rather than active trades? I know that when you catch the nonrunner being removed you will get a marketDefinition update and probably spot some TV odds that don't correspond to a true ladder price. Any suggestions?",
