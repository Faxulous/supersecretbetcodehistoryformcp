It tells the story of Navinder Singh Sarao, a UK based day trader who traded the stock market from a standing start (from his bedroom) to amass a fortune of ~£70m!..and then supposedly loose it...\nEnjoyed reading it, although a large proportion of the book is centred on the regulatory side of things.\nSome soundbites I took: \n\n- Nav was sell taught\n- His strategy was a simple scalping technique, by placing orders out of the money (on what we class as the back side), to skew the weight of money to give the appearance that sellers were in the market. Ie to push the price down. Tactics that are used on Betfair every day (probably by a few of us on here :-)\n- He ended up using a standard platform “Trading Technologies” (TT) and had some additional features programmed in by a software engineer at TT. He subsequently had a guy from Edge Technologies to further enhance those features and add a couple more (to take on the HFT’s)\n- He wasn’t 100% on auto. Rather, he traded manually with these extra “weapons” as he describes it\n- He didn’t write any of his own code\n- At his peak he was making upto £900K\/Day\n- He never spent anything! (Think he treated himself to a new bike and the odd McDonalds:-)\n- He attributed his success to his pattern recognition and fast reactions, the numbers dont lie, so can you doubt it?\n\nIf anything I think the book tried to paint a picture of his character, that I didn’t quite like. A bit of a dis service to him IMO. He is obviously a clever guy and its not always possible to determine intelligence or judge someone on how they come across that is perhaps different to the norm.\nI dont think this will lend itself to a film\/movie (Unlike The Big Short), However, it does make a good story and especially to us on here as a glimpse of the art of the possible!!",
