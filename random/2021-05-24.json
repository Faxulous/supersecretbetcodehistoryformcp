        "text": "Here are three examples of why it doesn't feel like Betfair is my \"partner\".\n\nFirstly, I think Betfair should be doing a lot more to protect customers from match fixing. There have been some blatant tennis match fixes recently which hurt us. I reported them to my account manager who has passed them on to the \"integrity team\" but nothing ever comes of this. Their policy is not to void markets based on allegations alone which I think is dangerous and may ultimately cost them as by keeping the market open they are facilitating the match fixing:\n\n&gt; Ultimately we don’t suspend betting as customers use the product with the expectations that they will be able to manage their positions. Market suspension would be detrimental to this, especially in the cases where the volume is substantial.\nThe volume is substantial because you have organised crime syndicates using your product!\n\n&gt; The difference between this and the sportsbook is that we choose not to offer bets on the Sportsbook if we suspect a problem, whereas on the Exchange it’s up to customers to make that judgement for themselves. It may be obvious in some cases, but obvious isn’t enough to go by until it has been proven after investigation by the governing body. \nThis seems like madness to me. It's not hard to notice that every other bookmaker has stopped taking bets on a match and to suspend and void the market in these situations. I think it's far better to err on the side of caution rather than risk supporting organised crime.\n\nThere is the particular case of Teymuraz Gabashvili, a player who is so bent that Betfair has not offered markets on his matches for years. Recently, they had markets on one of his matches, it was a fix and it cost us 5 figures. Well, they are back to not offering markets on his matches but did they void the market and refund our loss? No. My suspicion is that someone in market ops fucked up in creating that market in the first place. I didn't think it was necessary to have our own filter to prevent trading his matches because it's been Betfair policy for YEARS not to offer his matches. Was there any communication they would change that policy? No.\n\nSecondly, we've had so many problems recently with Betfair being late to create tennis markets, sometimes missing matches completely, other times only creating them once they've turned in play which inevitably means they end up having poor liquidity. It seems to me that it essentially boils down to:\n\n1. Poor integration with data feed providers. These have been WTA matches and the provider for these changed this year. Something with the integration is preventing these markets from being automatically created\n2. Lack of coverage from the market ops team. The problems normally happen on a Saturday morning; Saturdays tend to be days with lots of qualfiiers being played for the upcoming tournaments for the week. The schedule for the day typically gets published in the early hours of Saturday but if there are any issues with the automatic creation of markets it's not until around the middle of the day that these actually get resolved by which time some matches will have been missed. Seems like it's driven by whenever the guys working on Saturday get into the office\n3. Some weird regulatory issue where only the Australian team can create Australian markets. But the Australian team doesn't have 24\/7 coverage so when they've failed to create the markets but it's the middle of the night for them all we can do is twiddle our thumbs\nMy point here (aside from concerns about their technical capabilities re: integration) is that I have no problems making sure our systems are working at 7 am on a Saturday so I bloody well expect Betfair to be doing the same. Yeah, I get it, not everyone has the same work life balance as me but for an organisation the size of Flutter it's well within their capabilities to provide 24\/7 coverage on these teams. There's always sport being played somewhere.\n\nThirdly, site outages. We've all been hurt by these. Betfair can have a meltdown over multiple days but you can be damn sure they won't have any problems taking your premium charge.\n\nIn summary, if this was something resembling a true partnership I would expect:\n\n1. Betfair to care more about protecting its (premium) customers. They don't care (enough) if you get hurt for 5 figures in a match fix because they still get their juicy commission\/PC on the increased volume\n2. Betfair to pursue the same technical excellence that I aspire to. They don't care (enough) if I miss out on trading a few tennis markets because what could be hundreds of pounds in EV for me is a drop in the ocean for them\n3. Betfair technical teams to provide 24\/7 coverage\n4. Some compensation when their services fail",
