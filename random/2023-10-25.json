Here's another banger: <https:\/\/twitter.com\/therobotjames\/status\/1717053798739546221>\n\nIf you liked them, he's running another iteration of his 4-week <https:\/\/robotwealth.com\/membership-levels\/?pa=9A165184AF|Trade Like A Quant> course with sign ups open until Monday. I took it last year, really enjoyed it and thought it was well worth the money ($499). He runs it roughly twice a year and if you sign up you get lifetime access so I'll be participating again as it's always good to go over the fundamentals and he refines the content every time he runs it\n\nIf this sounds like a sales pitch, I would get a 10% referral fee if you sign up through this link but I'm more than happy to have a frank discussion about the course and answer any questions. Whether you want to facilitate my kick back or not, you can use the discount code TLAQTENOFF to get 10% off yourself",
