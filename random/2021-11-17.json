The ratings are significantly more accurate (i.e. correlate better with finishing position) than the Racing Post ratings (RPR). The site also displays the history of each horse's past performance in a rather unique way which I hope people will find useful. This site is not open to the general public yet but it is running with updates every day so I can give the automated systems a good workout. The site has a simple username and password of \"horse\"\/\"123\". I am looking for general feedback both on the website and the individual ratings themselves.
