I thought the settlement mistake is pretty obvious in the calculation of market subtotal in the screenshot here. how come £ -30.49 + 48.00 = -57? Think my P&amp;L should be +£17.51 (before commission), right? The betfair twitter help investigated and told me that \"Hi there apologies for the wait. Traders have reviewed this and have confirmed that they are happy with the settlement of this market. Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused you.\" Do I miss anything ... ? Thanks",
