The votes have been cast for Biden and now it's a matter of counting. But most importantly, the electors would belong to Biden regardless of whether he was alive or not. It's up to the party afterwards to then choose what to do with Biden's electors. Let's hope we don't have to sort this out. (And in full disclosure, I hedged by backing Harris in case I was wrong!)"

Im now looking into developing a full app with strategies etc. using the streaming API and I'm conscious ill need market data in order to backtest \/ validate them. I recall reading about the REST API that if you requested price data but were not placing bets that you would be disconnected.\n\nWith the streaming API is it possible to subscribe to price data without any repercussions? E.g. The first thing I was planning to create was an automated method of subscribing to all prices for all markets for a given event from each market creation until market closure with a result in order to build as much data as quickly as possible while I develop the rest of my app.\n\nFirstly, is this allowed? If so can you use the Live API key or is only the delayed key allowed?\nIf not allowed can anyone advise the best way to get as much data as possible for backtesting (Would rather not use the historical data as I dont think its either live or complete \/ rich enough for me). Feel free to point me to answers if this has already been asked but I was unable to locate.\n\nThanks in advance",

Im now looking into developing a full app with strategies etc. using the streaming API and I'm conscious ill need market data in order to backtest \/ validate them. I recall reading about the REST API that if you requested price data but were not placing bets that you would be disconnected.\n\nWith the streaming API is it possible to subscribe to price data without any repercussions? E.g. The first thing I was planning to create was an automated method of subscribing to all prices for all markets for a given event from each market creation until market closure with a result in order to build as much data as quickly as possible while I develop the rest of my app.\n\nFirstly, is this allowed? If so can you use the Live API key or is only the delayed key allowed?\nIf not allowed can anyone advise the best way to get as much data as possible for backtesting (Would rather not use the historical data as I dont think its either live or complete \/ rich enough for me). Feel free to point me to answers if this has already been asked but I was unable to locate.\n\nThanks in advance"
