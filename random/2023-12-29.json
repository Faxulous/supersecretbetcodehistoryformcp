Of course this means that there was already infrastructure there so that they could be deployed (which itself could take months), but basically don't expect time spent to be proportional to profit. At the same time, as long as you're motivated then it's worth keeping momentum - either eventually you'll get there, or at least you will have a good story to tell when doing interviews (assuming you're not doing silly things). And if you start getting tired of it...take a break."
