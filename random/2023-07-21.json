If you just want to play around a bit, you are likely better off with crypto. ETF's are tough, you are essentially trading indices, you'll end up with very low sharpe ratio's there. Better to trade futures right away. Depending on the kind of strategy you want to run you will end up with a low return on capital, so you rely on leverage to make it worthwhile.",
