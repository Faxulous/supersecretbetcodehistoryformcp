In 2025, I'll continue to suggest meetups (but might move to later in the month at request of one regular attendee), and will start to think about a mid-week London lunch club once a month - an hour or so midday for those who can't make evenings. Realistically will need to be somewhere in the St Pauls\/Fleet Street\/Chancery Lane\/Farringdon quadrant. If you're interested in that let me know. Venue will be coffee shop or other venue where we can eat (as you won't like when I'm hangry)",
