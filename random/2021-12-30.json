Don't bother trying to pick industries or regions as that's still pretty much pot luck.\n\nIn my ISA I made a few bets on specific stocks this year, and I'm up against indices, so it's easy to think I'm a fantastic portfolio manager, but the reality is that the sample size and time window is so tiny that it's just gambling. It can be fun though, which is why I've done it, but I'm thinking of being boring and sensible and converting my gains to my world tracker as well this coming year. "

When a major museum or and influential collector buys an artist that artist's value goes up - but both parties know that so the artist sells his flagship pieces to the collector a deep discount and makes up the difference by selling low end works (editions and so on) to Joe Public at inflated prices.\n\nDamien Hirst is one of the most egregious examples of this, his studio churns out endless editions of crappy paintings the depreciate like a new car, but the dynamic is the same all over the place.\n\nThe money side of the art world is completely filthy, corrupt and disgusting.

When a major museum or and influential collector buys an artist that artist's value goes up - but both parties know that so the artist sells his flagship pieces to the collector a deep discount and makes up the difference by selling low end works (editions and so on) to Joe Public at inflated prices.\n\nDamien Hirst is one of the most egregious examples of this, his studio churns out endless editions of crappy paintings the depreciate like a new car, but the dynamic is the same all over the place.\n\nThe money side of the art world is completely filthy, corrupt and disgusting. Steer clear."
