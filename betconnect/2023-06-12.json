For instance, in the OVER_UNDER_25 market, there are two runners, each with a specific id. As far as I understand, each of these runners corresponds to the possible outcomes of this bet (more or less than 2.5 goals). However, I would like to translate this id (for instance 47972) to a readable name such as (-2.5 goals) to understand what the selection means. How can you do this? Because I was trying to access attributes of runner such as \"name\", \" runner_name\" and so on and either they are not defined or are None. Any clue? \n\nThank you a lot :grinning:",
