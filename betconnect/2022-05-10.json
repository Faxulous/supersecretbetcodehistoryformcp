Matched bettors are attracted to the layside on BetConnect because you (API backers) are providing them with liquidity.\n\nThey will offset their risk on BetConnect by backing the same bet with bookmakers and take advantage of any promotions they offer. A match bettor is agnostic as to whether the bet represents -EV, all types of liquidity are valuable to them. Through our api, the ability to pump out hundreds of bets across multiple sports adds liquidity to the exchange eco system.\n\nHope this answers your question <@U011VL3CA2Y> - we'll upload more information on matched bettors and how they use our liquidity to make money.",
