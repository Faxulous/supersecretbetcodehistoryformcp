Hello everyone, we've got a few spots left for our first API event in Mayfair next week. It will be hosted at the Candy Capital bar where we will be chatting about our business model and the value that we are bringing to API bettors. This first event will be focused on backers, let us know if you want to come! :beers:

ah [@U02KNTX2Z7X](@U02KNTX2Z7X) beat me to it, are you calling that function first? im assuming nothing on the api has changed, so id say check [https://github.com/betcode-org/betconnect/blob/master/examples/dailyhorseracing.py](https://github.com/betcode-org/betconnect/blob/master/examples/dailyhorseracing.py) which should help with the workflow of getting correct ids

I can replicate the problem as described exactly by extending the competitor ID, and leaving the rest of the code in the same format as the horse racing example. If I put in the correct competitor ID, the bet is placed.

So doesn't appear to be a problem at the BetConnect end, though the error message received when the competitor ID is invalid is very misleading.

`__repr__` should generally be the Python representation of the object, if at all possible. You should be able to copy-paste the representation into a Python shell and get a valid object out.

**Ruben** - *21:05:55*

very interesting stuff....I am wondering what is your business model? meaning, if it is possible to back at bookmaker prices when they offer value, who is taking on this risk? the bookmakers? will they continue to do so once they realise that the bets coming from your bettors are -EV for them?

*Tags: Strategies*

## 2022-05-10

**Daniel** - *12:50:57*

Thanks for the question [@U011VL3CA2Y](@U011VL3CA2Y). BetConnect is an exchange and commissions are only paid by the backer (competitive rates + No premium Charge!). Matched bettors are attracted to the layside on BetConnect because you (API backers) are providing them with liquidity.



They will offset their risk on BetConnect by backing the same bet with bookmakers and take advantage of any promotions they offer. A match bettor is agnostic as to whether the bet represents -EV, all types of liquidity are valuable to them. Through our api, the ability to pump out hundreds of bets across multiple sports adds liquidity to the exchange eco system.



Hope this answers your question [@U011VL3CA2Y](@U011VL3CA2Y) - we'll upload more information on matched bettors and how they use our liquidity to make money.

**Sam - DH** - *13:14:07*

Afternoon BC, hit a bit of a wall using the api and python wrapper (has been blinding up to this point - nice work). Searched your git repo and this workspace, haven't seen this 'issue' addressed yet so, hoping itâ€™s not my incompetence and is just that we're the Lay-side early birds.



In short, I'm struggling to find an acceptable 'True' value for the accept_each_way param in /bet_request_get. I think there is also an issue in the way it's defined in filters.GetBetRequestFilter(), but, the parameter as a whole, server-side, I don't think is working as expected.



The above alone is probably enough for someone more switched on than me to work this out but, Iâ€™ll detail some more troubleshooting I did in this thread, in case itâ€™s useful.

*Tags: Deployment*

---

**Sam - DH** - *13:14:41*

I thought initially the issue was just GetBetRequestFilter() erroneously converting this param to a String value before making the request, as it's currently defined as

```accept_each_way: Optional[str] = Field(default=0)```

Which meant that even passing in the default value of 0 resulted in a

```message: accept_each_way value is invalid.```

error when attempting .bet_request_get().



Although I changed this param param definition to

```accept_each_way: Optional[int] = Field(default=0)```

and it still wouldn't allow 1 as a valid value; passing in 0 was now fine however.



Went on to try this just using the requests library and found similar problems, allows 0, doesn't allow 1, nor any other combination of 'True', 'Included' etc. so, main issue seems outside the scope of the wrapper.



Finally, had a quick look through the JS on your site for closure, and found a section that seems to confirm it should be dictated by a 1 or a 0 so, time to call in the big boys.



Cheers in advance for any help.

Sam

**Sam - DH** - *17:16:17*

Don't think I can feel too silly, did my best :joy:

Will raise request via wrapper's git to add option to exclude param - if possible.

Hey [@U9JHLMZB4](@U9JHLMZB4), we made some changes to `bet_request_get` to improve performance + added some functionality around layside filtering.

I'm not sure what specifically has caused the break because the output for `bet_request_get` hasn't changed, nor has the input.



We've rolled the changes back and we're investigating in the meantime. Can you let us know if you're able to get bet requests through the api again?

*Tags: Performance*

**Peter** - *15:03:43*

It's a pretty trivial change my end to drop that parameter. So I'll make the change. Because of the way my infrastructure works, it won't take effect until tomorrow. So if leaving that param out will cause a problem with your current codebase, please let me know ASAP. Thanks Sam.

Your question appears to be predicated on the assumption that layers on the platform are match bettors rather than traders. Though there appears to be a strong (and actively encouraged) leaning in that direction, it's not wholly accurate.

**Unknown** - *22:20:44*

Hi Everyone, i was invited by paulliam. My name is Jeffrey and I want to backtest some betting strategies on betfair historic data, and while doing so i stumbled accross the betfairleightweight code. Using the Betfair historic Data Processor, I do get a nice and tidy dataset. However this is a manual excersise and since I will have to do this for 10k+ matches it is not feasible to do it manually. I did some research and it seems to me i need 2 steps in which i am stuck:



1. get the json file into a nice and tidy format (csv), using `json.normalize` it does not achieve the desired result i get this (first image) while im looking for (second image, used by json converter) :

2. Still this is not a nice data set, when i go to [https://www.betfairhistoricdata.co.uk/](https://www.betfairhistoricdata.co.uk/)  I can put in my bz2 file and get a nice output (but this is all manual). 

I was wondering if it was possible to automate this process for a batch of bz2/tar files, so that I can rapidly process &gt;1k matches (files). I cannot find it in the python code of the the betfairleightweight package though. Can somebody help me out please, or point me to the code which does the conversion from json to the nice tidy dataset i get from the betfair processor.



Much appreciated, cheers Jeff

As far as betfair historical data is concerned I wouldnâ€™t go back more than a couple of years.  If youâ€™re strategies are looking at the amount of money being matched then old data behaves differently.

**Jeffrey Been** - *16:05:09*

I think you are misunderstanding the advantages of streaming, the [https://betcode-org.github.io/betfair/streaming/|docs](https://betcode-org.github.io/betfair/streaming/|docs) give a very good overview of why it exists.



So in your example you wouldn't stream each marketId but rather all the markets you require and then process/save what you require.



Although better practice would be to save the raw data via flumine or similar to then allow you to process at a later date when you need that extra field (this will happen)

## 2022-10-21

**Liam Querido** - *01:57:36*

Ah okay, I was wondering if it would be better to use Flumine rather than just betfairlightweight for streaming.



Do you know of any specific documentation that has what I'm looking for - using Flumine for streaming. After a brief search I see that there is plenty of documentation for Flumine.

*Tags: General Technical*

**Liam Querido** - *01:59:39*

I originally thought that Flumine was purely for backtesting, but by the sounds of it, it can be used to stream and save market data to csv?

Hi people!

I have a question about Streaming API messages rates, can't find an answer in the forum/docs.

Currently I use a "*delayed*" key and MCMs are received once a minute.

If I move to "*live*" key, will I be able to receive MCMs "*tick by tick*"?

I saw in the forum that there is limitation of 150/sec - so this will be the frequency?

*In general, what is the best option to be able to receive updates (MCM) in highest possible way?*

Thanks!

The code that I am running is below. Please let me know if logging would be useful. Thanks in advance!

I think we've established this is not a known problem which is a surprise given the high proportion of bets I've had it happen on. This suggests perhaps it's something sport specific if those of you who have engaged are not placing (many) football bets



I can take it up with support or privately with the BetConnect guys on here

Hi [@UBS7QANF3](@UBS7QANF3), we are looking into these problem bets now

Hi [@UBS7QANF3](@UBS7QANF3), we've identified the issue here. I can confirm that the settlement of these bets are correct, but it looks like there is slight display issue with the decimal odds on some of the bets.



We believe it is due to a mapping error for a particular bookmakers odds. We are looking into this now and will get it fixed ASAP. Apologies for the confusion here.

**Sam - DH** - *15:28:52*

Hey guys, I've been receiving a lot of 'Unauthorised' API response messages recently (earliest occurred on 16/08).



Couple observations:

â€¢ Seems to only occur when attempting to match a bet request, doesn't occur when retrieving bet request info etc.

â€¢ Happens maybe once or twice a week, and usually only lasts for around 45mins or so, but it is sporadic and bet-dependant it seems

â€¢ Restarts/re-authenticating don't appear to resolve the 'issue'

I've enabled some more verbose logging to determine which node it's happening to etc. If there's no obvious reason as to why this is happening from your end, I can provide more info over DMs.



Todays timestamps of errors are 14:16-14:26



Just curious to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong, and cautious to not be operating out of line with expected use. Having said this, I haven't changed anything in the X amount months we've been working with the API so, a bit stumped.



Any assistance greatly appreciated, cheers in advance

Thanks [@U035RKUN199](@U035RKUN199), just on a call but will check these in about 45mins.

I spent quite some time some digging into this over the past few days but haven't gotten to the root cause of the issue.

We have a planned release around session management/authentication for next week which I think could potentially fix this but it's speculative without knowing the exact cause.



I'll keep you updated

**Bookworms Inbox** - *13:45:37*

I have had developed a bot that looks to a certain telegram alert service for football games. The bot then sends the games to a csv for another software called BF Bot Manager to place the bets.



The problem we had was that the team naming convention from the alert service did not comply with that of Betfair and as such the bets were not placed.



We attempted to get round this by having the bot take the team names from the alerts and then comparing them with Betfair, and then interchanging the teams names to suit Betfairs naming convention, then the bot would send the amended team names to the csv for the other software to place the bets.



Problem is, it works well but does not match well, with very obsecure team names being returned, not even related tot he alert team names..



Please let me know, hopefully you can help

**Elliot** - *18:03:26*

Hi, Is anyone using websockets for price updates?

I have some code but its not quite performing as I imagine.

I subscribe to an event and the websocket is open however i receive no updates in real time. The ws stays open then dumps all the updates at once when the event starts and immediately closes the ws.

I imagined that i should get these onmessage returns as the price updates are happening live as opposed all at once to when the ws is closed.

I can send over code in a dm if anyone can help

Thanks

I get the messages in real-time with no issues using the python websocket-client package.
