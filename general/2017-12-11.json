        "text": "Hi Liam, Thanks for posting your betfair code on github.  I'm currently scraping data that I'll use for machine learning. I'm currently after highest price and lowest price matched data to establish ranges that I can use for machine learning on tennis data from 2016. I've downloaded a tar file which I planned to use with a python script and OS walk path. When I open the file there's thousands of subfolders and zipped files and I'm having issues trying to normalize the data to CSV.  I’ve seen your \n<https:\/\/github.com\/liampauling\/betfair\/blob\/master\/examples\/examplehistoricdata.py> file and I’m wondering since you have experience with betfair historical data if you could point me in the right direction? All I want to do really is build a list or dictionary in either json or csv to show Player names tournament name and highest lowest price matched inplay. Would you know if this data is available on the basic plan through betfair api?\nWhats the best way to get betfair data into a pandas dataframe?\nYour advice would be greatly appreciated! Many Thanks, Tom",
