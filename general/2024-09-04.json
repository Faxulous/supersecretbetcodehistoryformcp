        "text": "Hi <!here> i have been a relatively quiet watcher on this slack workspace - and want to dive in more and learn about the ins and outs of sports betting coding. I have been a python programmer for over 12 years, and some C++ and Java before that ( was in high frequency trading in finance sector). I have a property tech startup that I am winding down (due to business profitablity slowing down) and I want to go back to my love of quant + programming in sports betting, an area that I have slowly picked up some interest in. I also learnt Rust for last 1.5 years, used it on my own startup (which really didnt need Rust but used it to learn) and want to see if I can use Rust knowledge in bet-code\n\nI also helped start a crypto trading firm (so have some relatively newer experience in programming for excahnge trading - around 2018-2020 - was working part time with them)\n\nI learnt a bit of the betfair api - but not much,and want to dive in.\n\n*questions:*\n1. What are the best resources to learn production level (or near production level) sports betting. Are there good videos or paid training material that explains a lot of things in one place? \n2. Is someone looking for a partner to do it with - perhaps someone who knows more about the sports betting side of things, and some programming experience - and I can help them with my knowledge in programming ?\nWill be good to help others and learn in the process\n\nThanks again",
