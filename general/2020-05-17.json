I already analyzed Betfair historical data using R, parsing the files with a json package and eventually creating rows with things like runner name, batb, batl, etc. I have got the examplestreaming script to generate data for the markets that I am interested in, and if I save market_book.streaming_update as a .txt and then substitute a few things, I can parse it as a json file, but it is missing some of the higher level data that I need, like the runner ids and runner names. When I click around the market_book (object?) in my variable explorer in Spyder, I can see that it looks like all the stuff I need is probably already there. Are there some examples of parsing this data into usable tables, or is there a way that I can retrieve the data to look more like the historical bz2 files that I am used to now?
