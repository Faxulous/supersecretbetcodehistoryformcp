I've not used them myself though because I want to stay off the tax man radar with respect to crypto transactions. Still seems a bit of a grey area to me in UK (gambling is tax free, crypto gains are not) so I won't use it until it becomes my only option. That seems years away, but you never know with the way this Labour government are going (not to mention the anti-gambling grifters who never seem to run out of steam or money).",

I've not used them myself though because I want to stay off the tax man radar with respect to crypto transactions. Still seems a bit of a grey area to me in UK (gambling is tax free, crypto gains are not) so I won't use it until it becomes my only option. That seems years away, but you never know with the way this Labour government are going (not to mention the anti-gambling grifters who never seem to run out of steam or money)."
