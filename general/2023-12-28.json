Understand that the data returned by the inplayservice contains no timestamp describing when the associated data was updated; therefore as noted you are having to rely on the low level timestamp that records when the Score object is locally created - i.e. it's approximately when you received the score data not when Betfair received it\n3. Conversely, the MarketBook contains the publish time - both as integer milliseconds (publish_time_epoch) and a datetime object (publish_time) - which is a timestamp that Betfair generated rather than one you created locally\n4. In terms of what you can technically compare - it would be _datetime_created from the Score with publish_time from the MarketBook\n5. However, whether it is a good idea to be comparing these things is a judgement call you have to make. To be crystal clear: you have no idea whatsoever how stale the inplayservice data is",
