I had assumed that the cashout process should equalise what happens if your your horse wins or loses. But now AFAICT what it does is it equalises what happens while totally ignoring the effects of rule4 deductions. So if a good horse withdraws at some point between the original back bet and the subsequent cashout, you can be left with a position which is very lopsided with regard winning vs losing. Can anyone confirm this is so?",
