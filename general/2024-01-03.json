I think any of the established players you talk to will tell you this game is getting increasingly harder. How much of that is down to lower liquidity versus increased competition is hard to say. And how much of an impact on liquidity the affordability checks are having is anyone's guess\n3. For example, <@U4H19D1D2>’s shared that his pnl is down 30% for the year. It doesn't take that happening many years in a row for there to be (much) easier ways to make money\n4. I can't go into details about the costs but if you think of a number and then multiply it by 100 you might be getting close to the total. Another factor is a lot of them are denominated in foreign currency so the exchange rate is another vector by which I can get be screwed over\n5. I've tried to expand into market making and have been getting fucked in the arse by Betfair transaction charges. The lack of support from Betfair to encourage liquidity provision has been really disappointing",
