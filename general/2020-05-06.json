Off the shelf stuff...yes, I had quite a few things working on horses\/tennis  for weeks at a time then they would suddenly turn which made me wonder what was going on. Too many unknowns as possible reasons but when you can't see the code you can't eliminate technical reasons.I guess that answers my question. I have worked in IT for a long time and I'll consider learning python but at nearly 50 I might be too late.Anyway thanks again for the  reply."
