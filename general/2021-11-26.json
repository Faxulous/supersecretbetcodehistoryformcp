        "text": "Sorry to be a dischordant note here but I believe in this project. As an example I am 50% manual gambler and 50% automatic trader in football and I am collaborating with another company that allows me to place my manual bets with them too and is working pretty well so far. I am still risking the same stakes of my own money but if it goes well I get the gains from this fund. About Mike and randickgroup I was speaking to him yesterday and it sounds legit, and the way it will work it looks unlikely to be a scam. I can explain why I think it can work for most people who have an edge. It doesn´t matter what your edge is, there is always ways to squeeze it harder by increasing risk. So for example, if I have a strategy where I bet 20.000 bets per year with a ROI of 0.5%, why not try to bet 20.000 more with a ROI of 0.2%? In my case I prefer to separate the riskier projects, so I use different accounts, platforms, etc, and I think a company like this will help me increase the profit without increasing the risk. 25% sounds fair to start, in my opinion. Think that many traders will cause them losses, but I think that if you are a successful one you will probably be able to negotiate different conditions with time. Also the fact that is a company where you can invest makes it interesting, but that is because I like the stock exchange and there are not many similar products in the market.",

As an example I am 50% manual gambler and 50% automatic trader in football and I am collaborating with another company that allows me to place my manual bets with them too and is working pretty well so far. I am still risking the same stakes of my own money but if it goes well I get the gains from this fund. About Mike and randickgroup I was speaking to him yesterday and it sounds legit, and the way it will work it looks unlikely to be a scam. I can explain why I think it can work for most people who have an edge. It doesn´t matter what your edge is, there is always ways to squeeze it harder by increasing risk. So for example, if I have a strategy where I bet 20.000 bets per year with a ROI of 0.5%, why not try to bet 20.000 more with a ROI of 0.2%? In my case I prefer to separate the riskier projects, so I use different accounts, platforms, etc, and I think a company like this will help me increase the profit without increasing the risk. 25% sounds fair to start, in my opinion. Think that many traders will cause them losses, but I think that if you are a successful one you will probably be able to negotiate different conditions with time. Also the fact that is a company where you can invest makes it interesting, but that is because I like the stock exchange and there are not many similar products in the market."
