Unfortunately, there are restrictions relating to the onward supply of specific data via the API (specifically football related data) but we are investigating the incorporation of other data feeds at the moment, including improved feeds for horse racing.\n \nThe inclusion of raceType is on the current API roadmap and we are looking to integrate this data as soon as possible but don’t have a specific ETA.\n \nWe are working to make improvements to the consistency of market names &amp; abbreviations across the platform. \n \nWe don’t have any plans to add specific results data into the API.  Customer who require results data following market settlement can use the historical data service (via <https:\/\/historicdata.betfair.com\/#\/home>).  This data includes the result for each runner by name within the free BASIC data files.\n \nWe don’t have any plans to remove the time delay associated with in-play betting.
