However, there are some instances were they are dramatically different. e.g. (A ladder mid point of 4.9 and BSP of 1.11).\nI probably only have a couple hundred of these instances in a sample of 600,000 so am not overly concerned but would like to identify if it is likely i have made a coding error or this can be expected based on the way in which BSP is constructed.\n\nMany thanks for any help!\nNick",
