I am happy to do this but obviously if I take it and make profit and pay the old man his share I am going to end up getting shafted on PC if I ever get that far. To that end I would prefer to give him a bot that he can run himself. My question is, how is this sort of thing viewed by betfair? They would be able to see 2 similarly themed bots running surely. Would they see this as some sort of PC avoidance if it were coming from 2 accounts that were clearly related (same surname living in fairly close proximity etc) ? I am WAY off PC stage and have a lifetime loss of 50K to make back first but I am sure you can see the dilemma. Any thoughts?",
