It's almost a standing joke amongst successful players that we get used to politely explaining to friends and acquaintances why we don't need their investment. Even a modestly successful player will have more funds than they can deploy and a frequent question here is _\"how can I scale up - it doesn't seem to work.\"_\n\nWe've also got used to seeing \"professional traders\" advertising that they need investment but that's always met with derision. _\"System working, send more money\"_. Yeah.\n\nSo it seems like this lot are looking for that lot - the winners who haven't won. Why?
