I am placing an order using <https:\/\/github.com\/betcode-org\/flumine\/blob\/master\/flumine\/markets\/market.py#L79|place_order> and then checking the selection's exposure using <https:\/\/github.com\/betcode-org\/flumine\/blob\/master\/flumine\/markets\/blotter.py#L185|market.blotter.get_exposures(self, lookup=selection_lookup)>. Could it happen that the order gets matched and goes to EXECUTION_COMPLETE, but being the latency very high, the selection's exposure doesn't consider this order? In this case, my strategy would think this order never existed and place it again",
