Most papers for in-play prediction assume points in tennis are independent and identically distributed. Well, if you play the game you know the answer is no. Only a non tennis player would make that assumption. And then a paper that tries to test the theory uses data from one single tournament over 4 years, a Grand Slam on the fastest of surfaces, which is not representative of tennis as a whole, and for which the data set is too small",
