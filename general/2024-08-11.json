If you’re making rather than taking, and your prices are more than 1-2 pips away from each other (back\/lay spread on US racing can be very broad), someone new could be doing the same strategy “inside” your prices. Can you go back and check what volume was matched at a price other than your own?\n2. Your hosting setup has changed. Data centres get new links, retire old ones, your VPS could now have a noisy neighbour sucking bandwidth, and so on, and so on. Doesn’t take much to add 10ms latency onto a box. Even worse if you’re running from home (residential broadband especially over OpenReach makes no guarantees about anything, ever)\n3. You were betting against another bot, you’ve taken their money, they’re gone.\n4. Variance. Law of large numbers says you’ll have bad runs now and again and sounds like this has been running for a long time. I know you asked how to check it’s not chance alone, but one easy check is to wait another few days where the odds become smaller and smaller",
