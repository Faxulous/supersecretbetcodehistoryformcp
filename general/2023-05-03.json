I thought though that if my lifetime comms generated weren't X% of my lifetime profits (X being 20% or 40% depending on the band) I would incur PC on winnings each week until they hit that band.\n\nI can see a scenario there where say you win 1 in 10 bets but are below the life time comms level you are then charged PC on the winning bet which effectively brings your commission paid on that bet to well over 5%.  If the net gain from winning bets as part of a strategy is much lower but you are still losing the same amount on the losing bets in the sequence then it can turn a strategy unprofitable no?",

I thought though that if my lifetime comms generated weren't X% of my lifetime profits (X being 20% or 40% depending on the band) I would incur PC on winnings each week until they hit that band.\n\nI can see a scenario there where say you win 1 in 10 bets but are below the life time comms level you are then charged PC on the winning bet which effectively brings your commission paid on that bet to well over 5%.  If the net gain from winning bets as part of a strategy is much lower but you are still losing the same amount on the losing bets in the sequence then it can turn a strategy unprofitable no?"
