You need to have the live key enabled for streaming (the delayed key is useless for this unfortunately)\n2. You need to be placing real money bets at the same time (even if only in small size), you can't just record, otherwise you will get your account blocked\n3. There are A LOT of football markets, so you may find it necessary to use multiple connections (i.e. a different connection for each OVER_UNDER_XX if you are looking at more than one)...you may find you are initially limited to 200 markets per connections and 10 connections, this can be tricky for football as if there are over 200 markets (quite likely) you will get an error! If that happens you can either try to look at market_types that have fewer live markets or speak to Betfair to get your limit increased (but referring back to point 1, you may need to be placing live orders for this to happen).\n4. You can loop through the market book to get the price data and need to match the market_id &amp; selection_id (and handicap, but this will always be 0 for football) to the market_catalogue, there is an example here: <https:\/\/github.com\/betcode-org\/flumine\/blob\/master\/examples\/strategies\/lowestlayer.py>\nThat hopefully helps you get started, but of course, please feel free to ask away if you get stuck!",
