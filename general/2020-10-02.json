So if you wanted a setup where you had say, one process per market, then you can't use a dedicated streaming session per market if you plan on trading more than 10 markets concurrently (for the reason Misha mentioned above). But republishing internally is a way around that, and the added latency is dwarfed by external network latency. Decided not to opt for Redis now given zmq is sufficient",
