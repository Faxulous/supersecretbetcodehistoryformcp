Trying to refine existing strategies? Looking for 0EV stuff to generate commission? I have spoken with a few directly via DM so apologies to those for duplication. To be honest, I've found the chunks of money that disappear on Wednesdays really really demotivating (despite it being a very priviliged position to be in). I suppose I am \"lucky\" that I started off with such a large negative lifetime P&amp;L at my \"turning point\" that I'd built enough commission to skip the lower rate entirely and not had time to acclimatise. I don't know everyone's situation so possibly some people had it forced on them at inception? Is there any generic advice other than \"suck it up and count yourself lucky\" ?? Any info at any PC level would be of interest to be honest as I am really struggling for motivation at present.\n(Just to be clear, not looking for any dodgy advice like multi accounting etc.. or anything that will get me booted from Betfair)",

Trying to refine existing strategies? Looking for 0EV stuff to generate commission? I have spoken with a few directly via DM so apologies to those for duplication. To be honest, I've found the chunks of money that disappear on Wednesdays really really demotivating (despite it being a very priviliged position to be in). I suppose I am \"lucky\" that I started off with such a large negative lifetime P&L at my \"turning point\" that I'd built enough commission to skip the lower rate entirely and not had time to acclimatise. I don't know everyone's situation so possibly some people had it forced on them at inception? Is there any generic advice other than \"suck it up and count yourself lucky\" ?? Any info at any PC level would be of interest to be honest as I am really struggling for motivation at present.\n(Just to be clear, not looking for any dodgy advice like multi accounting etc.. or anything that will get me booted from Betfair)"
