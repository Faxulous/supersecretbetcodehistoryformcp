I thought this might have something to do with the fact my account has never had funds deposited but when i use his details\/account to access the bf api the odds I observe are the non-funded account odds. Is this due to the fact that it is a delayed app key i am using? I was under the impression the odds data should be the same but delayed by up to 180 seconds for a delayed key but the difference in odds persist over much longer durations. cheers",
