I have cannibalised some code online to extract the following data from the Betfair Historical Data BASIC soccer files. It has the last pre-play odds and the ltp which is more than I ever expected to get! However, what I would really like is to adjust the code so it produces a similar Excel file but with the last pre-play odds (already got), the half-time odds (if the market is not closed at half-time), the highest price traded and the lowest price traded. If at all possible as a cherry on the top, if all of the recorded odd movements could be put into the columns to the right from the market going in-play until it closes that would be great. Apologies for such a basic question, finding my feet with coding!",
