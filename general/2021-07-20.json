First of all i'd just like to clarify what causes both of these functions execute. The documentation says that process_market_book logic executes upon \"True\" being returned from the check_market_book function but the process_orders function is a bit more ambiguous. Will this also run upon a market_book being recieved from the stream?\n\nSecondly is there anything that stops multiple orders being placed on a single market when the market conditions are right? For example say i want to place a \"back\" order of stake £10 on a given market when the best back odds are &gt;3. Currently i dont understand how it wouldnt empty my account on repeated runs by placing many £10 orders whilst the conditions i have specified for placing are true (inside the process_market_book function). I'm sure this isnt the case but any clarification would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

                                "text": "Just getting started with flumine and there are few things I am wondering about the process_market_book() and process_orders() functions. First of all i'd just like to clarify what causes both of these functions execute. The documentation says that process_market_book logic executes upon \"True\" being returned from the check_market_book function but the process_orders function is a bit more ambiguous. Will this also run upon a market_book being recieved from the stream?\n\nSecondly is there anything that stops multiple orders being placed on a single market when the market conditions are right? For example say i want to place a \"back\" order of stake £10 on a given market when the best back odds are >3. Currently i dont understand how it wouldnt empty my account on repeated runs by placing many £10 orders whilst the conditions i have specified for placing are true (inside the process_market_book function). I'm sure this isnt the case but any clarification would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
