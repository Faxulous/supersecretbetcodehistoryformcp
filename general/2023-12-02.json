        "text": "Hey all, hoping someone can help me understand the ‘available to back’ price and sizing for runners (horses) in a WIN market.\nFrom a conceptual perspective, I want to understand how the available to back prices equate to traditional book makers odds in order to get a better understanding what I’m looking at in betfair markets. This isn’t for building a strategy, just to help aid my knowledge when analysing betfair market book data.\n\nIn a traditional market (e.g. on <http:\/\/bet365.com|bet365.com> or <http:\/\/www.tab.com.au|www.tab.com.au> etc) the fixed-odds available in a race is set by the platform and are traditionally BACK odds. In this example on bet365, at a point in time *Horse A is given a 9.7 odds to win*. The same Horse A on Tab sports has 9.8 odds to win.\nIn Betfair we receive the following EX for Horse A:\n```Horse A - EX Details:\n - Available to Back: [{'price': 9.6, 'size': 7.03}, {'price': 9.4, 'size': 18.77}, {'price': 9.2, 'size': 12.29}]\n - Available to Lay: [{'price': 10.5, 'size': 11.79}, {'price': 11, 'size': 18.89}, {'price': 11.5, 'size': 3.6}]\n - Traded Volume: []```\nSince betfair operates as a betting exchange, where bettors can bet against each other in a market exchange, we are provided with the market book for that runner. My understanding is that therefore the best available price to back on betfair for Horse A is *9.6* and this is the true reflection of the price provided by the other markets. But this maybe naive because it doesn’t consider the size or volume traded at this price. E.g. since the size is 7.03 is less than half of the size available at price 9.4, maybe is 9.4 a truer representation of the best backed odds for this horse? Do we need to take some average or consider volume or size to find this equivalence?",

Is it fair to say that the second price is far more representative of what the market thinks the fair value of the horse is at that point in time since less than 1% of the market has priced it at 9.6? Therefore this would be the comparable price to other traditional markets? I.e.\nTab sports is giving 9.8 returns for this horse winning\nBet365 is giving 9.7 returns for this horse winning\n99% of Betfair punters are given 9.6 returns for this horse winning"
