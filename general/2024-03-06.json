He again ignored me when I tried to dissuade him from selling the bottom when it was around $3k a BTC.

He wanted to invest £10k in bitcoin - I told him to buy £1k a month for the next 10 months but he's a greedy f*cker and bought the top with the whole £10k. He again ignored me when I tried to dissuade him from selling the bottom when it was around $3k a BTC. People will do their own thing regardless if they are greedy and feel that they are missing out."
