I've been thinking about writing up some stuff on this, but it's complicated because I work for AWS, and if I discuss or write anything in this space I have to a) make it clear I'm doing so in a personal capacity, not as an employee and b) still get it checked by PR, Legal, and \"bar raised\" by a bunch of solution architects.\n\nPutting all that aside, except please, accept this is a personal recommendation, not an official one: Fargate, DynamoDB and Aurora all allow you to forget about a lot of BS you probably don't want to spend time thinking about. Archiving to S3 is :+1:, but querying it with Athena for most people is :money_with_wings: compared to getting it into a DB. Consider Compute Savings Plans and Reserved Instances to bring down costs significantly. Also, if you want to ignore that and go simple, it's OK to throw up EC2 instances for a while and work it out or even look at Lightsail and App Runner if you want to, and then optimise later.",
