I would like to build an app that replays Betfairs horse racing historical data with ladders setup like Gruss or Bet Angel and able to place fictional bets and trade just as if it were real. I realise it's a tall order to build a complicated app with no experiance but I have plenty of time on my hands since I am out of work and have plenty of evenings to start learning. I have downloaded some sample horse racing historical data pro and advanced, Python installed and betfairlightweight and a few other addons. I guess I'd like to know where to start and if someone could point me in the right direction I'd be very greateful. Kindest regards Jeff",
