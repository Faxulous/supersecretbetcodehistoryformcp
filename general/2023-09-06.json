I read something about a well known punter  in the horse game on the BA forum falling victim, but in this story it is important to note that he REQUESTED his account be closed because he had no intention of providing financial details. We need to know real detail of what will\/will not happen if we fail AC before even thinking about supplying such data.\nThis is part of the problem though - there are no \"rules\" as such so bookies are just doing these things in a seemingly haphazard and inconistent manner. Combine that with the fact that 95% of social media as absolute nonsense and the picture becomes even more fuzzy. I've still yet to actually converse with ANYONE directly who has been asked to provide details for an affordability check - everything is a third party account from questionable sources.\nI was deeply concerned for a while and it still is worrying but I've given up worrying about it too much now because there are just too many unknowns.",

I read something about a well known punter  in the horse game on the BA forum falling victim, but in this story it is important to note that he REQUESTED his account be closed because he had no intention of providing financial details. We need to know real detail of what will\/will not happen if we fail AC before even thinking about supplying such data.\nThis is part of the problem though - there are no \"rules\" as such so bookies are just doing these things in a seemingly haphazard and inconistent manner. Combine that with the fact that 95% of social media as absolute nonsense and the picture becomes even more fuzzy. I've still yet to actually converse with ANYONE directly who has been asked to provide details for an affordability check - everything is a third party account from questionable sources.\nI was deeply concerned for a while and it still is worrying but I've given up worrying about it too much now because there are just too many unknowns."
