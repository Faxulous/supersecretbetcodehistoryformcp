In other words, do you separate out between trades that did a roundtrip vs. the others? And then potentially mark the others to some number, like the average price of the market when it closes, or the ultimate success of the horse\/bet?\n\nOr do you just mark all your trades to that number at the end, roundtrip or not? You could also do this while looking at the size of your net open positions, which kind of achieves the effect of separating them out.\n\nI had a long discussion about this with an HFT friend today and ultimately I don't think it really makes a big difference, but thought the conversation was pretty interesting and curious if people have other perspectives!",
