The order gets placed and then moves to `EXECUTION_COMPLETE` status. Nothing happens afterwards so I would expect no updates. However, Flumine keeps calling `process_orders` like mad for some reason, despite there being no changes in orders. The strategy is initialised with `streaming_timeout=None,` so it should not be down to `snap` being called on cache.\n``` Time                    | Source              |   Order count | Order status log\n-------------------------+---------------------+---------------+-----------------------------\n 2024-02-09 22:35:05,801 | process_market_book |             1 | Pending\n 2024-02-09 22:35:05,847 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending\n 2024-02-09 22:35:06,009 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending\n 2024-02-09 22:35:06,273 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:06,526 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:06,780 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:07,034 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:07,287 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:07,538 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:07,790 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:08,044 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:08,298 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:08,549 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:08,799 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete\n 2024-02-09 22:35:09,051 | process_orders      |             1 | Pending, Execution complete```",
