If you were to calculate the round trip time from server to the betfair api and then the return response to be say 5ms plus the bet delay of say 1000ms ie a combined 1005ms, what would be the first leg to betfair (as it goes via the DDOS provider.  I think i remember <@UBS7QANF3> saying the first leg is longer than the return but just wondered if anyone had an approx idea please? ie does the first leg make up 60% of the total time etc. Thanks",
