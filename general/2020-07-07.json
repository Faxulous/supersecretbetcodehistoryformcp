Here in 2020, and after using my own library (<http:\/\/BespokeBots.com|BespokeBots.com>) for many years, I've decided it's time to get to grips with this new-fangled streaming API malarkey. Was going to code my own library but there is no good reason for me to do so when <@U4H19D1D2> has already created this marvellous resource. I'm on a bit of a learning curve at present because Liam has written \"modern\" Python code, whereas mine is very old fashioned and only uses very basic implementations. Having said that, my simple library has served me well for many years and has more than paid for itself.\n\nMoving forward, I've run a couple of the bflw\/flumine examples (copy\/paste code!) and have login\/etc working as expected. Planning on mining some data initially to get familiar with the syntax, pitfalls, etc. Can anyone suggest the best way to go about mining data with this library? Also of interest, what format is required for backtesting?\n\nRegarding data mining, has anyone considered combining data as a pooled group? i.e. if \"N\" people were all mining data, the combined efforts would help to eliminate those \"missing\" sections that we encounter when we lose connection. Also, if we were mining ALL available markets at a sensibly throttled speed, the combined data would achieve a much better granularity, simulating something close to what we would get if we were concentrating on specific markets at balls-out speeds. This would require a pre-agreed structure, but is easily solved if all members use the same framework. Is this do-able, or does it contravene some clause in Betfair's T&amp;C's?",
