        "text": "IMO, the last decade or so has been a steady decline in exchange betting in general as most of the younger generation are less interested in \"old man\" sports like racing. Of the many \"gamblers\" I've worked with over the years, there are basically 3 distinct groups:\n1. Those that \"like a bet\" who are seemingly obsessed with accumulators and have near zero understanding of the probability of picking 7 correct football scores. They're also the type of people who buy £20 worth of scratch cards several times a week because they \"won\" £50 last month. I've introduced quite a few to the betfair exchange, but they ultimately end up going to the sports book or casino games because they want big returns for their £10 bet.\n2. The slightly more educated \"investors\" who understand that a 10% ROI is good but aren't interested in short term betting markets. They're generally into Forex\/crypto\/poker\/etc, where \"skill\" is required. With the advent of low\/zero charge stock apps like Trading212, etc I know of quite a few that are fairly clueless but have the buffer of being able to wait for longer term recovery when they get it wrong, so as far as they're concerned they're semi professional.\n3. Those with a genuine interest racing\/football\/etc, but they're going to the meetings and having a punt for fun and aren't bothered if they lose.\nThe rest of us degens have spent years doing ok but the hours spent getting there probably equate to minimum wage. But we're enjoying the challenge. :grinning:",
