My goal is to be able to read in odds, market ids and selection ids from a csv, and then place kill or fill bets within a few mins before start time for racing markets if my odds are different to the market odds. Then, if I dont get matched, to put orders at the top of the queue, and if those dont get matched, to take BSP. I feel like it'd be relatively easy to implement without the stream, but am pretty stuck as to how to implement it with the stream. Would I have a script that runs 24\/7 and continuously searches for upcoming markets (say within the next 5 mins), and then if it finds any, adds them to the listener? Does the listener automatically disconnect from markets when they have closed? So many questions! haha",
