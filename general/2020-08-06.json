It's very interesting\n\n1. what do you mean by the matching engine nuances? are you referring to the matching engine cycles here or something else?\n2. In general, what steps do you take to maximise your matched volumes and how you take advantage of 1.?\n3. in the above - do you refer to in-play betting in particular or deadball too? (I recall you are doing inplay horses yourself right?)\n4. I don't do any in-play stuff myself, but very curious how yourself\/others go about it for in-play when things move fast? Cause horse racing in-play looks crazy - do people just throw a bunch of FOK orders all the time or smth? Because I see matched volumes go up fast and yet it's almost impossible (with a human eye) to see where it's happening. \n",
