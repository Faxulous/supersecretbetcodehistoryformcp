I use multiprocessing and I usually test on 20,000 horse racing win markets at a time  and save the data to S3 in parquet files, then load up in jupyter. Whilst fast, it still takes me longer than I would like to back test the markets (a single strat takes 10's of minutes). I was wondering if anyone with can suggest how to scale this or if there is something I am doing that is obviously wrong.",
