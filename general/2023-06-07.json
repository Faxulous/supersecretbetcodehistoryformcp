I was constructing an extensive odds feed database myself to validate my value models over the last couple months. So far so good, but now I want to backtest my models on my data feed. I have written a custom game matcher which matches games from different bookmakers, however what I am still struggling with is a good source for historical results data. Sure, I can extract many result stats from my data myself, but I would rather enjoy an API service that lets me pull results (including corners etc.  besides just goals).\n\nSo my question to you guys is, are you using 3rd party services to get results data on already finished games, and if you do, can you maybe point me to a place which offers a great sports\/league coverage? It doesn’t need to be a free service, paid services are also welcome if they offer an API endpoint to pull historical results. Thanks.",
