Does anyone have any betfair documents on the topic, specifically which fields are effected and any relevant calculations. One thing im going round in circles currently is the traded price size (trd) and the total volume (tv). It seems as though the traded prices are updated (setting old values to zero and new ones to the adjusted amount), but would we also expect the size to change and the total volume (tv). In my mind size = price * stake , so with an updated price the size and total volume on the runner should also change,  or am I confusing size with stake.",
