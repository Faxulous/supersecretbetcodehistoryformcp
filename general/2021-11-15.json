        "text": "Hi everyone, I've noticed that most people are using Flumine, and apparently it's a more advanced tool. I'm a beginning programmer, I understand Python for working with data science, statistically analyzing data and things like that. I have a betting system using the platform before betfairlightweig and everything works fine, it's a simple system that I was able to develop just using the documentation.\n\nAnyway, I'm trying to learn Flumine but it's challenging for me, I haven't found any real and complete tutorial or practical example. The content of the documentation is quite confusing for a beginning programmer, without practical and simple examples, at least for me.\n\nI would like to know where to start, what I need to study for how to understand the system because I don't even know where to start.\n\nSomeone has a basic code, like for example checking the odds prices for the over 2.5 goals of Liverpool's next EPL game and placing a bet.\n\nThanks",

I'm a beginning programmer, I understand Python for working with data science, statistically analyzing data and things like that. I have a betting system using the platform before betfairlightweig and everything works fine, it's a simple system that I was able to develop just using the documentation.\n\nAnyway, I'm trying to learn Flumine but it's challenging for me, I haven't found any real and complete tutorial or practical example. The content of the documentation is quite confusing for a beginning programmer, without practical and simple examples, at least for me.\n\nI would like to know where to start, what I need to study for how to understand the system because I don't even know where to start.\n\nSomeone has a basic code, like for example checking the odds prices for the over 2.5 goals of Liverpool's next EPL game and placing a bet.\n\nThanks"
