For example, say the new day has ticked over and new markets exist in the marketcatalogue, how do you ensure that these new markets will be picked up in the stream? My current understanding is that using the *clk args are for only a pre-defined stream, and not for a complete refreshed re-subscription.\nRight now I am 1. initialising the stream once in __init__ using self.stream.start in a new thread with daemon=True (as in the examples), then 2. periodically calling stream.subscribe_to_markets() in my runtime loop without initial_cl and clk when the market_catalogue polling code detects new markets. I never .start() that previously created thread ever again.  Is this the best way to go about this?\n\ncheers!",

                                "text": "? For example, say the new day has ticked over and new markets exist in the marketcatalogue, how do you ensure that these new markets will be picked up in the stream? My current understanding is that using the *clk args are for only a pre-defined stream, and not for a complete refreshed re-subscription.\nRight now I am 1. initialising the stream once in __init__ using self.stream.start in a new thread with daemon=True (as in the examples), then 2. periodically calling stream.subscribe_to_markets() in my runtime loop without initial_cl and clk when the market_catalogue polling code detects new markets. I never .start() that previously created thread ever again.  Is this the best way to go about this?\n\ncheers!"
