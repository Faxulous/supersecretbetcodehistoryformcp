You want to automate placement of said bets? Flumine will handle the latter, but you'll probably need to supply it with your bet selections. Basically, if your bets are chosen by using market data or external 'live' data feeds, then you can do all of that in Flumine. If your strategy is not time sensitive, i.e. you preprocess some third party sources, then (to me) that's a separate project where you create a list of bets and execute them using Flumine.",

You want to automate placement of said bets? Flumine will handle the latter, but you'll probably need to supply it with your bet selections. Basically, if your bets are chosen by using market data or external 'live' data feeds, then you can do all of that in Flumine. If your strategy is not time sensitive, i.e. you preprocess some third party sources, then (to me) that's a separate project where you create a list of bets and execute them using Flumine."
