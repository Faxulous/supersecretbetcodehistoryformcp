Our api docs are here: <https:\/\/api.dev.goated.com\/swagger-ui\/> and we have built an sdk here: <https:\/\/docs.goated.com>.\n\nI love what the community have done here with *betfairlightweight* and would love to get a similar high quality sdk for Goated so that existing betfair traders can also connect to Goated easily. Are there people here who might be exited in working with me on this?",

Our api docs are here: <https:\/\/api.dev.goated.com\/swagger-ui\/> and we have built an sdk here: <https:\/\/docs.goated.com>.\n\nI love what the community have done here with *betfairlightweight* and would love to get a similar high quality sdk for Goated so that existing betfair traders can also connect to Goated easily. Are there people here who might be exited in working with me on this?",
