I've been interested in gambling for over 30 years. For the first couple of years, I was a typical \"mug\" punter who did a 25p EW Lucky 15 every Saturday and watched the horse racing on TV. It was great entertainment and not a particularly expensive hobby, because I was pretty decent at reading form and had a lot of \"unusual\" insights that gave me a slight edge. During that time, my father and I decided to put £10 each into a pot and we both picked a few horses every Saturday. I always placed mine as single bets, ranging from £1 to £10 depending on how strongly I felt about the horse's chance of winning. He always did a Lucky 15 or a 3 horse Patent. From that point onwards, I no longer did Lucky 15s or any other kind of multiple bet beyond a (very) occasional EW double. And that was because I realised quite early on, that when I had 1 or 2 winners out of the 4, that backing them as singles paid out far more often, albeit at the cost of missing out on \"the big one\". But more crucially, I also realised that you could build a bank by taking lots of small profits rather than waiting for occasional bigger payouts. After 18 months, we had just over £1000 in the pot, most of which came from my bets. We split it 50\/50 because I'd just discovered beer and women. The money didn't last long.\nSeveral years later, I started looking at betting again and developed many strategies, writing them all in a notepad. Around 1999\/2000, I bought my first laptop and discovered spreadsheets. And porn. One pixel at a time, because internet was dial-up back then. I learnt VBA because Excel just wasn't cutting it. Then VB6 because VBA was too slow. Then I discovered Flutter, who were bought out by Betfair shortly after. While watching the markets in bewilderment, I noticed that the books would occasionally go the wrong side of 100%. Knowing how bookies made their money, I attempted to catch these spikes manually. It didn't go well. So I made it my mission to automate it. It took me the best part of a year to learn how HTTP, HTML, Ajax, etc worked. It was hard going as I was never academically minded. But I never gave up. Finally, I had a home-made web browser spoofing, 50 times a second polling, page scraping, data collecting, bet placing API that (so I thought) was totally unique. Another year or so of tweaking and testing followed. I made a few grand from that strategy, but it took me several years to get there. Then competition started to grow and finally, it died a long, slow death, particularly when cross-matching was introduced.\n\nRoll forward to the present.... I still have lots of \"wacky\" strategy ideas that I need to test but rarely have enough time to give them the devotion they need. The markets are far more efficient nowadays than they were years ago, BUT small edges (<=0.5% ROI) are still fairly easy to find and can make reasonable long-term profits with lower variance. The biggest issue with these is getting large quantities of bets matched. You won't become a millionaire overnight, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nTo put things in perspective, the professionals on here are generally peaking at 4% or 5% ROI over millions of bets. Mere mortals like us can't even get close to that level without a LOT of work. Or a lucky find.\n\nSo my suggestion is: go right back to basics. Pick an obvious strategy like laying 3 runners at <3.0, backing both players in 2-player markets to achieve a book <100% or even laying any runner<2.0. If executed correctly, all of these will make a small profit. And it's obvious why. Then work on increasing your match and hit rates. Pick ONE strategy and do everything you possibly can to make it work. Avoid shooting off at a tangent when you think of something else. Write it down. You can work on that next year.\n\nAbove all, never attempt to build a \"trading\" strategy where you are intentionally hedging your bets. Trading is for mugs. There's nothing wrong with hedging bets in order to reduce volatility, but, as "
