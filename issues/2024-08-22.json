I am not sure how this works given that for a last price traded to exist, a trade must have taken place and therefore the total matched must not be zero.\nI am using runner.total_matched with the listener kwarg \"cumulative_runner_tv\": True\nI have attached a zip folder containing a python file, sample market and log file that highlights the issue. Please have a look at the log file (LPT, total_matched columns) to see that some runners have total_matched = 0, and a non zero LPT value.\nThanks!",
