The export instructions do not align with the current available XCA version. The first part of the current export instructions says to export .pem from priviate key tab (IGNORE THIS INSTRUCTION). The next part of the instructions is correct, export .crt file (perm*.crt, latest edition) from certificates tab (this is the file to be uploaded to betfair security settings). The next step (not in instructions) is to stay on the certificates tab and export 'pem + key (*.pem)' file, this is the file that needs to be stored in your certs_path directory. The non-interactive login worked using this process.",
