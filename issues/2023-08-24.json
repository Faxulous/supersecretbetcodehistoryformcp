        "text": "Hi all! Question regarding execution in flumine. I'm trying to backtest my strategy using fluminesimulation and stuck with how orders are executed. Market for a runner was at 1.65-1.66, I had a limit order @1.66 for 186. In the next tick market moved to 1.66-1.67 &amp; actual volume traded in market was 245.82 &amp; I got a fill @1.66 for 122 size. Firstly, how does flumine allocates size in case market moves through your price? 2. I changed the profit variable in the LoggingControl(the one available on git)  simply with order.profit as with the usual one was giving profit variable as 0 for all the orders &amp; this change actually worked. But for the order described above it assumes that I got full(186 size) fill &amp; then calculates the PnL.",
