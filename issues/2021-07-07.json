Amazing stuff from what i can see, big thanks to <@U4H19D1D2>\nI am currently trying to build up a database with that i can do backtests and filter markets (for the backtest), and down the road maybe also track the orders i have placed per strategy. First step i wanted to get an idea of the general structure of how all of this is going to look like. I see flumine comes with a market_recorder (and an s3recorder on top) and a backtest function, so basically all i need is being provided, i just have to connect the puzzles pieces :smile: The s3recorder seems to throw out some zip files (1 per market), which i am supposed to store in a s3bucket. Are these the files i am supposed to feed into the backtest machinery? Assuming thats how its done, i need to know which files i throw into the backtest for a certain strategy, so i need a way to filter these markets. I was thinking that this one be one job of a database, which for example has basic information for each market_id, like what event_type it is, time of the event, runners, etcetc. How would i go about building such db? Can the market recorder also be used for this? or would i extract this info straight from the files in the s3 bucket?",
