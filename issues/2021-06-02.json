Replace moves the price to 1.43 (so 33p now remains @ 1.43)\n4. Flumine shutdown (as in killed by me, stopped overnight, not a socket error)\n5. Flumine restarts and the trade no longer appears in the blotter\nFrom what I can see, a trade simply being replaced shows up correctly, so although I can't prove it, it looks like its something to do with the size (possibly its failing a check somewhere and I haven't spotted where yet)?",
