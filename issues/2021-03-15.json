But then Flumine by default runs the login procedure for self.client - and then everything blows up - because normal login does not work for danish authentication. I fixed it by simply commenting out self.client.login() in the enter method of BaseFlumine. Everything seems to work fine.

If this method is indeed ok, then maybe the framework should detect when the client has the session token set, and just skip login? ",
