You may want to consider pulling the market IDs column out as a series and requesting the data for multiple markets at the same time.

Matches_BetExchange.values.tolist() would be hugely better. You then use a lambda function to sort the list (another CPU-intensive action) - much faster would be to sort the list in Pandas, taking advantage of it's built in indexing, before extracting the data.",
