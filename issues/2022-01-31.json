To be clear, I'm not (just) trying to prove a point here, I am trying to understand if it's reasonable for a customer like myself to be unaware of a planned maintenance window. Is it poor communication on Betfair's part or a failing on my part?\n\nI'm aware that the developer forum exists and that posts are created there about planned maintenance. However, I think we can all agree that aside from the official Betfair communication, the quality of posts on that forum is poor and there is no reason to use that resource other than to receive the official Betfair communication.\n\nIs it too much to expect that one of the several Betfair employees that are members of this Slack also let us know about planned maintenance windows here?\n\nShould Betfair be paying megabucks for consultants to tell them how to grow the exchange before sorting out some basic community engagement? Why don't we have our own <@UUUAJQZ5J>?",

To be clear, I'm not (just) trying to prove a point here, I am trying to understand if it's reasonable for a customer like myself to be unaware of a planned maintenance window. Is it poor communication on Betfair's part or a failing on my part?\n\nI'm aware that the developer forum exists and that posts are created there about planned maintenance. However, I think we can all agree that aside from the official Betfair communication, the quality of posts on that forum is poor and there is no reason to use that resource other than to receive the official Betfair communication.\n\nIs it too much to expect that one of the several Betfair employees that are members of this Slack also let us know about planned maintenance windows here?\n\nShould Betfair be paying megabucks for consultants to tell them how to grow the exchange before sorting out some basic community engagement? Why don't we have our own "
