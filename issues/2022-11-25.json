I was wondering if there was a way to intrinsically link the the selection ids provided in via the market_book object from the following call: market_books = trading.betting.list_market_book(WINNING_MARGIN_ID) , to the actual wining margin buckets listed in the ui:\nhome 1-12\nhome 13+\naway 1-12\naway 13+\ndraw\nin other markets ie MATCH_ODDS, the market_catalogue would give a list of runners with both selection_id and team name leaving little ambiguity to exactly the selection that the an order is going down on. However the runner list inside the catalogue for the winning_margin is empty so im not sure what selection_id corresponds to which points bucket. Also i cant find a sort priority field. I thought the index of the runners inside the market_book might be the way to ultimately determine the corresponding points bucket but this doesnt seem particularly safe as i have seen instances in the past of runners indexing not matching up with traditoinal home, away, draw ordering. Two currently listed rugby games which have this empty market_catalogue runners include\n\nHarlequins v Gloucester,  eventId: 31925868,  WM marketID: '1.206774481'\nNewcastle v Exeter,  eventId: 31925869,  WM marketID: '1.206774284'\n\nIs there anyway of identifying wich selection_id corresponds to which win margin bucket through the information available from market_book or market_catalogue that i am missing?\nCheers",
