If that's the case, then it seems logical that Flumine would need to handle `BET_TAKEN_OR_LAPSED` and update the order status to either `EXECUTION_COMPLETE` or flag it some other way. I'm assuming that this is actually an issue at Betfair's end and Flumine is simply relaying the received order status? If that's the case then all you can do is save the order id to market.context (or wherever) and ignore it in your cancellation call.",
