It's the whole book, and it happened the other day as well. On a reboot of the program it's done the same thing again. Log files are showing old prices, with the book just not being updated.  What do I need to check to analyse the problem \/ what should I be on the lookout for?\n\nI am running a beta version of my script to add untested strategy on the same ec2 instance, so there are multiple scripts pulling the data with the same address or whatever. I don't think there are any memory problems because it's happened again after I've checked that.\n\nThe prices on the other script running look fine - different strategy names if it helps.",
