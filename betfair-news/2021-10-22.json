When I send a bet in-play, for example in horse racing, I get a 'pending' response, but this response doesn't include the timestamp that the order was received at the Betfair server. This timestamp must exist in order for Betfair's tech to know in which sequence all orders were received. It would be great to have this timestamp included in the pending response, so that I can measure my latency \"from door to door\" accurately.\n2. On the market data stream we receive a 'publishTime' which is presumably the time at which the matching engine cycle finished. It would also be useful to have a field that represents the time at which the matching engine cycle began. This would enable me to look back at the logs and say: OK, my order didn't arrive in time to make it into this matching cycle which began at T1, so it was delayed a bit longer and had to wait for the next one, which began at time T2.",

Spoofing is problematic, but has nowhere close to the same level  of impact. With CFD manipulation you have a customer who may make a reasonable bet, but gets shafted after the fact due to manipulation. The customer has no way to mitigate this problem, and thus the offering itself is fundamentally flawed. CFDs are an interesting idea, but with the fractured liquidity due to so many sporting events (as opposed to fewer stocks\/currencies\/etc), I don't think it can work.",

It would exacerbate the problem. Spoofing is problematic, but has nowhere close to the same level  of impact. With CFD manipulation you have a customer who may make a reasonable bet, but gets shafted after the fact due to manipulation. The customer has no way to mitigate this problem, and thus the offering itself is fundamentally flawed. CFDs are an interesting idea, but with the fractured liquidity due to so many sporting events (as opposed to fewer stocks\/currencies\/etc), I don't think it can work."

I didn't mean to sound as if I was asking about asynchronous orders. I am really just interested to know how best to measure latency from door to door - and I am sure others would be too. Your thoughts on that would be greatly appreciated.\n• Something like placedDate is _*possibly*_ what I am looking for, and I should have mentioned it as a possible solution. However, it currently doesn't help because it seems to be rounded to the nearest second or at least doesn't display any precision further than that at all, which is frustrating.\n• Furthermore, even if placedDate was a millisecond-precise quantity it's not entirely clear (to me) what the meaning of this value actually is. Does it describe the time that the order arrived at Betfair's servers, or does it represent the time that the order was considered by the matching engine perhaps?\n• In terms of question 2, I suppose what I am really after is a way to figure out exactly how much slower my order was than the one which got the fill that I wanted. Let's say a horse falls and I want to be the first to lay it. So I send a LAY order to Betfair, but it doesn't get filled, because someone else was faster. It's pretty hard in this situation for me to know whether I \"lost\" the race for liquidity by 1 millisecond or 200 milliseconds. I can look at the publishTime of the stream update which shows the successful order, but there's no way to track that successful order backwards in time to know what time it arrived at Betfair's server compared to what time my order arrived. I was just thinking that, if I knew how long the specific matching cycle in question had taken, that would enable me to work backwards and make a good estimate of when the successful order arrived. And, if I also had a good idea of what time my order arrived, then the difference between the two represents how much I lost the race by. \n• If I'm going to lose the race by 200ms then I may as well give up; if I'm mostly losing by 20ms then I should probably carry on trying and maybe invest in some better technology!",

Let's say a horse falls and I want to be the first to lay it. So I send a LAY order to Betfair, but it doesn't get filled, because someone else was faster. It's pretty hard in this situation for me to know whether I \"lost\" the race for liquidity by 1 millisecond or 200 milliseconds. I can look at the publishTime of the stream update which shows the successful order, but there's no way to track that successful order backwards in time to know what time it arrived at Betfair's server compared to what time my order arrived. I was just thinking that, if I knew how long the specific matching cycle in question had taken, that would enable me to work backwards and make a good estimate of when the successful order arrived. And, if I also had a good idea of what time my order arrived, then the difference between the two represents how much I lost the race by. "
