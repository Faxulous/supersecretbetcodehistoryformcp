Sorry if this is a dumb take, but your first sentence kind of suggests this. On the assumption that the above is true, how then does BPE get implemented? If a better price becomes available, does my bets \"pair\" get replaced with the better offer while the delay is still in action?\nI'd always assumed that your bet was received, and queued at time of receipt and that once the delay was over the matching took place based on the market state. Is there anywhere we can get more details on how the matching engine operates currently with the inplay delay?\n\nSorry for all the questions but I've confused myself trying to run this through my head.",

Sorry if this is a dumb take, but your first sentence kind of suggests this. On the assumption that the above is true, how then does BPE get implemented? If a better price becomes available, does my bets \"pair\" get replaced with the better offer while the delay is still in action?\nI'd always assumed that your bet was received, and queued at time of receipt and that once the delay was over the matching took place based on the market state. Is there anywhere we can get more details on how the matching engine operates currently with the inplay delay?\n\nSorry for all the questions but I've confused myself trying to run this through my head."
