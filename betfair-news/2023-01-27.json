Over £20k matched at SP including \"take BSP if unmatched bets\" (which don't show as SP bets on the graphs). There was also money matched against \"non-SP unmatched bets\" that were in the market and pulled into the reconciliation, which is promising and helps towards reducing the amount of bets that lapse. It's been enabled for tonight's game, the 14:30 Bundesliga games tomorrow and Sunday's four La Liga games.",
