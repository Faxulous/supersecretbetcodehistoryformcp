I could run it on my local machine but ideally don't want to have to have my laptop on 24\/7 so looking to move it to the cloud. I've previously written a similar automated script trading crypto through a Binance API using a combination of Kaggle notebooks and PythonAnywhere (followed a guide on Towards Data Science) but when I try to do the same using betfairlightweight I get a 403 error when logging in which I'm assuming is a result of the servers being based in the US. So question is, how would people recommend I move my script to the cloud? Would ideally like to use the Kaggle\/PythonAnywhere route if at all possible given I'm paying for that already, but can sign up to something else if I have to! Thanks in advance!!",

What exact prerequisite knowledge should I have before even attempting to do so? I’m specifically interested in doing Horseracing if that helps.\nI’ve got a background in Math (studied Civil Engineering at uni) and I’ve studied Python for a few months now (was playing around with Selenium in Pycharm to automate work things) but not too confident on what I should be learning exactly from all the Python content out there. I’m just wondering what the next steps for myself are. I’ve watched a few tutorials on the Betfair Youtube channel and have had a look through a few resources that I think I should go through:\n1. Learn Intro to Stats 110x - <https:\/\/learning.edx.org\/course\/course-v1:HarvardX+STAT110x+2T2021\/home>\n2. Learn how to use R - using <http:\/\/Datacamp.com|Datacamp.com>\nI'm just trying to put together a learning curriculum for myself to give myself a realistic timeline, and I feel like there’s more to it than just what I’ve found as I don’t know what I don’t know, so does anyone have any suggestions? Also let me know if this question has been asked already as I couldn’t find a similar thread anywhere.",

I’m just wondering what the next steps for myself are. I’ve watched a few tutorials on the Betfair Youtube channel and have had a look through a few resources that I think I should go through:\n"
