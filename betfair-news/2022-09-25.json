My data use\/bet size ratio has improved very dramatically so that's not an issue anymore but there's a couple of things I've been doing recently that I wanted to check on. Firstly - I'm wanting to leave my trading unattended for hours and just for safety I'd like to take all but the bare minimum required cash in my account each day and put more back in the following day - we're talking a few hundred pounds. Would that cause a problem? Secondly, I've been trying a strategy of putting in a bet request above the market price and then gradually lowering it as race time approaches. But for programming simplicity it's actually easier to cancel and then make a new request (not sure if the API lets you change your requested odds anyway). So for any one horse I might make of the order of a dozen bets that get requested and cancelled before an order is accepted. The duration of any single requests is at least ten seconds. Might this cause me any trouble?",
