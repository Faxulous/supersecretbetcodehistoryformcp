Not meaning to take attention away from Neil's message above on a far more important matter but for the BSP fans....After another solid month of BSP Football, we've decided to add all Grade 2 competitions, which will more than double the number of BSP Football markets to around 4,000 per annum. This means we'll be capturing match odds markets that account for over 60% of volume but less than 10% of football fixtures, so we have headroom to explore further if there's demand. I've attached a list of all Grade 1 and 2 competitions with their current status.\n\nWe'll review again next month to see whether we should add new football markets (over\/under goals, correct score) or a new sport such as golf or look at Grade 3 football. I'd be keen to hear from anyone who had a particular view on this.",
