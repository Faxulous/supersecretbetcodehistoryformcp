We're on day 2 of live testing (fake matches), so far so good and we're still on schedule to load the first real markets for some ITF matches next week.\n\n_Hi all, Joe's right, the long-term plan is for bets in the bet delay to also skip the rest of the delay if the bet it was going to match disappears. That won't be included in part 1 though, this will be a proof of concept until around March._ ",
